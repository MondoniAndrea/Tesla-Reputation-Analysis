post,12vc334,,Elon Musk products are like NATO weapons systems -- overpriced and overhyped,"I can't help but noticing, as I follow developments in the Russo-Ukrainian war, just how much the descriptions of NATO weapons sound like descriptions of Elon Musk products like Neuralink and Starship -- ""revolutionary"", ""a game-changer"", ""unprecedented"", ""unbeatable"".   And, I also can't help noticing, that Russia still keeps gaining territory, despite these ""magnificent"" NATO weapons systems that the Ukrainians are employing.   Indeed, both the Russians and the Ukrainians seem to do just as well with Soviet era weapons, or even WWII era weapons.   Even Elon Musk's ""magnificent"" Starlink system doesn't seem to be giving the Ukrainians much of an edge in this particular war.   This makes me wonder if Elon Musk is actually a symptom of a much broader problem in Western science, engineering and business, in general.   To what extent is the entire construct of Western science and engineering a giant Ponzi scheme, in which Elon Musk is merely one of the largest of a great number of Capitalist Spiders at the center of an enormous web of corruption and incompetence?

&#x200B;

It is notable that the life expectancy of the average American has dropped from 80 to 76 in the last twenty years, while Russian life expectancy has risen from 64 to 73.  So, why are we saying that Vladimir Putin is an incompetent, corrupt dictator, while American Presidents are noble, virtuous and brilliant in all things?   Indeed, given that currently we are trying to put our last President in prison, why are we saying this, at all?

&#x200B;

Certainly, American engineers, doctors and scientists claim immense progress in all things.   And, indeed, there have been certain developments and changes over the last few decades -- we all have cell phones, and we have more computer technology in automobiles.   We have the GPS.    Does the GPS represent an improvement over ordinary maps?   Possibly.

&#x200B;

The GPS is often cited by physicists and engineers as an overwhelming proof of that greatest of ",1682182661.0,2023-04-22 18:57:41,1,11,Traditional_Star_850,Musk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Musk/comments/12vc334/elon_musk_products_are_like_nato_weapons_systems/,True,0.55,2023,both,search,False,False,0,

post,13i3qqy,,Are we idializing Elon?,"Ok, before anyone start saying that I'm an Elon hater or anything like that. I'm not. I'm just curious and I do actually admire him. I would love to do as much as he does. Also I'm sorry if I'm paraphrasing and giving wrong information (please correct me in a polite manner of so).

So, that said. I've been reading about his history and what he has done etc. But one thing that stocked me was when he said that he learn about rocket science by just reading books. Now, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I doubt you can learn as much by just ""reading books"". They are one of the best sources of knowledge, but I think also time, practice and experience take a big role as well. And he hasn't been working in the space industry before spacex for all I know.

That made me wonder, are we just idializing Elon? Is he is a ex start up CEO who sold his company and made millions and now controls others companies and knows how to market himself? Or is he really a genius?

It feels like he is really good at marketing himself as a genius. But again, is this true? Can we become a master of something by just reading books and talking about it? Or is he a master of marketing?

It started with solar panels and two batteries: Works great. A giant middle finger to PG&E.

Then we bought a used 2023 Model X Plaid: Super great deal, no annoying cosmetic issues (minus one rattle on the seat beat adjuster). Finally used FSD and it’s a game changer on long trips. On any trips really. 

Also learned to use Superchargers: Awesome. We can watch Netflix while charging. It doesn’t even take that long. And all of Superchargers we’ve been are clean and safe.

Then we bought the Tesla wall charger: Awesome! No more trips to gross gas stations.

post,1h5uf8x,,My 24’ M3 LR AWD,"i (22/m) got my first car (that i bought and wasn’t a 20+ year old hand me down) 🥹🥹🥹
pros
car go brrrrr: 0-60 in 4.2 seconds is by far the fastest car i’ve gotten to drive more than for a day or two (i rent a lot of cars as i travel a lot.) 

home charging: although i live in nyc, i have a garage and have only super charged a total of 4 times. 3 because of a road trip and one was on a trip to the hamptons. 

full self-driving: cars drive itself. that’s pretty cool man

customization: the ability to change the car’s appearance from the exterior, to the software, it’s all just so darn fascinating. 

drive: great speakers, adjustable steering, drive modes, a quiet cabin and great suspension makes this an absolute beaut to drive daily. i find myself going on drives to absolutely no where and willingly sitting in traffic just to be in the car. 

cons
driver door mode: i wish driver door mode included the trunk so badddd. it’s a minor issue that’s more software rather than the car but let’s face it, this is a computer that can drive. 

turn signals (kinda): i don’t really dislike the turn signals at all. i got used to it from test driving the car before i got it. it is a bit strenuous to click them when the wheel is turned already. also, i wish they were their own buttons with proper cut outs. i at times click the right and the left clicks and vice versa. 

panorama room: this is more of a me thing. i personally would have preferred them following what the model X did or just none at all. i will agree, riding through the city with the current roof, i do get jealous of the back seat passengers as the views are pretty sick. 

overall, my first 5 weeks (1,600 miles) have been really fun and i enjoy my purchase! my only regrets is not getting the white seats and i often times think about the performance but maybe that’ll be next years project… BUY TESLA!!!",1733250834.0,2024-12-03 19:33:54,70,33,zayyNYC,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h5uf8x,False,0.83,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1gvi0nk,,Opinions on model 3/Y/X after test drives,"Over the last month, I’ve test driven several 2024 Tesla Models (3/Y/X). Here are my general thoughts.

*Disclaimer* I currently don’t own any Tesla products expect a level 2 Tesla wall charger for my house

1) HW4 is awesome especially in its current version (12.5.6.3). Yes it’s not perfect, but highway is almost perfect. Overall 95% of time, it can function without any intervention. If there’s something even close to FSD, please let me know because I would love to know and try it out. I would pay a lot of money if Mercedes or BMW is somehow able to buy the licensing rights to FSD in the future. 

2) Model 3 highland (2024 and higher) is vastly superior to previous model 3s. Having test driven the 2024 model X, I would say the new model 3 is almost as comfortable despite not having air suspension. I would venture in a blind test, it would be difficult to tell apart a model x and new model 3 as far as cabin noise and overall ride quality. 

Of note the non performance seats are softer and more comfortable in comparison to the performance bucket seats which I found to be stiffer. And the smaller wheels of the non-performance version make the ride slightly more smoother. Overall I would say the AWD or RWD at 35 or 40k after tax credit is the best small/mid size sedan in the market today and nothing comes close in this price range.

3) I was overall impressed with the 2024 Model Y as far as versatility. I would probably buy the Model Y today if project Juniper was already out. In comparison to the refreshed model 3, the current Y is definitely noisier and slightly harsher ride quality particularly in higher speed and bumpier roads

4) Model X although is very spacious and airy/roomy, it is overpriced and in serious need of a refresh. Once the Y is refreshed, model X sales will plummet even more. Overall very disappointed in Tesla’s luxury trims. They really do seem like a legacy model at this point and the focus seems to have purposely shifted towards model 3 and Y ove",1732079181.0,2024-11-20 06:06:21,10,37,LakerDoc,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1gvi0nk/opinions_on_model_3yx_after_test_drives/,True,0.69,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1grcdao,,Tesla Announces V4 Supercharger Cabinet,"[Video Link](

[Article Link](

Article Contents:

Supercharging has come a long way — our first opening in 2012 started with charging speeds of just 90kW.

Since then, our engineering teams have continuously been upgrading our Supercharger equipment.

In 2023, we launched our V4 Post, which made improvements to the charging experience for all EVs.

Today, we're announcing the V4 Cabinet — capable of delivering up to 500kW for cars and 1.2MW for Semi.

* Faster charging: Supports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures, including 30% faster charging for Cybertruck. S3XY vehicles enjoy 250kW charge rates they already experience on V3 Cabinet — charging up to 200 miles in 15 minutes.
* Faster deployments: V4 Cabinet powers 8 posts, 2X the stalls per cabinet. Lower footprint and complexity = more sites coming online faster.
* Next-generation hardware: Cutting-edge power electronics designed to be the most reliable on the planet, with 3X power density enabling higher throughput with lower costs.

Our first sites with V4 Cabinets are going into permitting now. First openings in 2025.",1731610920.0,2024-11-14 20:02:00,184,34,DefinitelyNotSnek,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1grcdao/tesla_announces_v4_supercharger_cabinet/,True,0.97,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1ggxolc,,Looking to buy my first Tesla in Texas stuck between new Model YP or new Model 3P,"Essentially as the title says I’m looking to purchase my new Tesla model 3 or Y I’ll be buying it cash incentives are cool but don’t influence my decision. 


I love the new model 3 Performance and think upgrades are great it looks I know it received as well new batteries and technology and longevity is better then Legacy models thing is im torn choosing between model 3 Performance and model Y because I need a bit more space, as I already have a sports Sedan, model 3P is faster but I need more practicality and tow hitch so I can haul a small trailer with stuff, but It’s basically a Legacy Version now, 

I’d like to get the latest and greatest tech and just keep it and put as many miles as it can handle, is their any updates on Model Y battery technology or facelift design one of my biggest buying factors is FSD on Tesla, as I’m super busy and need to take calls and send emails and thing out when I’m either stuck in traffic or driving across the state of Texas, 

Should I buy FSD upfront for 8k or pay the $100/month? 

I heard price of FSD will go up! 

Model Y Performance owners what’s the avg range you get 

Model 3 owners what’s your average range regular driving.

Cyber truck Tri motor owners what’s your avg range… 

Originally I wanted a Cybertruck still do but for such a big truck I expected range to be 400 or more so I’ll hold off until V2-V3 comes out lol but curious. 

My main thing is I want FSD which can be had on any of these models, but I want the performance for when I want to do spirited driving or feel the power… 


I need the car now but I can wait 2 months maybe 3 months I rather not too, but what the latest with model Y (project juniper) their no official updates will it release Q1 2025, or later like Q3? Is it worth the wait or should I just get model 3 Performance.

Was driving at the end of the day down a 55 mph 2 lane road (one lane going east, one going west, normal painted line down the middle).

I was getting a little frustrated not being able to find information of where the GSM chip is located or even if it has a physical chip or an esim to change it out after arrival to keep premium connectivity working. I do realize that it is not as simple as just swapping the sim card and that a confuguration change with toolbox 3 is required in the software. 

Then I just thought of this:
1. Get a local mobile gsm wifi router.
2. Connect the cybertruck to that wifi network.
3. Change the settings to keep power plugs in the car and bed powered all the time.
4. Plug the mobile gsm wifi router into the 110 power outlet in the center console and leave the router in there.

With this setup the cybertruck should be connecter constantly to wifi as long as the wifi router has GSM connectivity.

post,yw85ie,,2018 vs 2022 Model X long term family focused comparison,"I had a 2018 X for, well, about 4 years. I've put about 8k miles on the refresh and wanted to share thoughts for anyone thinking about upgrading.

Range - Huge win. I went from 270 to 340 miles, and faster charging. Add it all up and charging stops are about half as long as they used to be on road trips, since you can stay under 60 percent easier. Great!

Interior quality - Good improvement. Nicer materials. Everything is just a touch better. Still a small step down compared to my Genesis GV80, but it's fighting in the right league now.

Speed - Noticeably faster, even without plaid. Teslas are very fun to drive, and the refresh is better. 

Autopilot - Draw to slightly worse. I don't have the phantom braking issues I was expecting, and some parts work better, but there are a lot of small new bugs as well. Stop and go traffic, one of my biggest priorities, is worse as it slams on the brakes when someone 20 feet ahead slows down. I have to wonder if this is because they axed the radar. It ends up being slightly dangerous in city highway traffic jams. 

Controls - Disappointingly a little worse. No stalks, the yoke looks cool but isn't as functional, I'm tired of the button turn signals, I honk when turning on autopilot once a week, etc. These are just unforced errors, and while none are as bad as I feared, they are absolutely a small step back from a normal car.

Audio - Neutral. Was hoping for something a bit better, but no biggie.

Rear seat screen - It exists. Not really sure why it's there, or why there's a powerful GPU. Please give me more range instead. Kids don't really watch it because it's strangely positioned.

Suspension - A bit better. Again, not bad, but not as good as the GV80.

360 surround view - how is this still not a feature?

7 seat vs 6 seat - 3 wide second row is great if you have 3 kids. 3rd row is worse, but if you can use it a lot less, 7 seats is the way to go. Plus you get extra cargo space most of the time.

post,ys9orl,,Musk: Twitter and Tesla will be better next year,"According to reports, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter today that despite the difficult economic situation, several of his companies will be in a good position in 2023.

&#x200B;

In addition to serving as Tesla CEO, Musk is CEO of Twitter, space exploration technology company SpaceX, brain-computer interface company Neuralink, and tunnel-digging company The Boring Company.

&#x200B;

And just a day ago, Musk just said that he does not rule out the possibility of Twitter going bankrupt in the future. Yesterday, Musk said in his first email to Twitter employees: ""If Twitter cannot offset the impact of declining advertising revenue by increasing subscription revenue, the company will likely not survive the coming recession.""

&#x200B;

About 90% of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising, and Musk said the flight of advertisers has caused Twitter to lose more than $4 million a day. He believes that Twitter is too reliant on advertising revenue, vulnerable to a pullback in brand spending, and needs to increase subscription revenue.

&#x200B;

Currently, Twitter has about $13 billion in debt and faces interest payments totaling nearly $1.2 billion over the next 12 months. The sum exceeds the company's most recently disclosed cash flow, which was about $1.1 billion at the end of June.

&#x200B;

At the same time, inventories at electric car maker Tesla are also growing rapidly. To boost sales, Tesla has also lowered the price of the Model 3 and Model Y in individual markets and offered additional rebates to buyers who purchase insurance. But Musk said last month that demand was strong in the fourth quarter and Tesla was expected to be ""recession-resistant.""",1668171353.0,2022-11-11 13:55:53,3,1,Timkain,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ys9orl/musk_twitter_and_tesla_will_be_better_next_year/,True,0.81,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,yeag2x,,Tesla's in-car data speeds in New Zealand is terrible and has been for a while now,"With the huge boom in sales of Tesla's in New Zealand (Model Y was the [top selling car in September]( the quirky setup Tesla has for in-car data connections seems to have become overloaded. The point of this post is to try get some visibility on the issue.

For some background, Tesla in New Zealand does not use any of the local carriers to provide connectivity. Instead, they use a Telstra connection (an Australian cell carrier) that then roams on New Zealand networks. I believe they then have a private APN for the connection as services see the connection as coming from Australia, so Netflix shows the Australian library rather than New Zealand and local NZ streaming sites don't work due to their geoblocks not seeing a NZ connection.

The above was probably fine when Tesla was lucky to sell 1000 cars a year when it was just the Model S & X, but now that they're selling a few thousand cars a quarter it's clearly overwhelmed. Currently, owners are lucky to get 600kbps - here's what I got yesterday:



It's at the point now that even connecting to the car via the Tesla App is almost unusable. I literally need to leave the app open 5 mins or more before it will eventually connect to the car (while it is awake due to Sentry being on). Spotify is often unusable now and Netflix, YouTube etc is not even worth trying. Why pay for Premium Connectivity to get near dial up speeds?

People have reported that Tesla is ""fixing"" it but that was a few months ago now and it's only gotten worse. I personally don't see a roaming Australian connection as being feasible going forward - it's time Tesla used a local NZ carrier, even if that takes away the one perk of this setup where the car can roam onto whatever network has the best coverage.

Before people might blame the local carriers, no, our 4G network is more than capable of delivering 50mbps+.",1666822065.0,2022-10-27 00:07:45,79,25,Matt_NZ,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/yeag2x/teslas_incar_data_speeds_in_new_zealand_is/,True,0.82,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y3bg89,,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route.

For people talking about tires and what to do because “it's a Tesla” and somehow different from other cars here is your link 

They are just tires. Go to some place and make sure they know about the jack pads and ask if they have jacked up a Tesla before. Here is a screenshot from Tesla’s support page. 

I keep on getting flats/punctured tires. My tesla sucks, I have never had a problem with my other cars in the past with so many flats.

Do you have the sport wheels? They have less room to give. Do you run things over? This is a given. Do you hit pot holes? Hitting potholes with sport wheels is very bad. Hitting potholes with non sport wheels is also bad but you can sometimes get away with it. Do you keep your tire pressure at the right levels?

post,y2bwo8,,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It’s so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I’m always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment’s notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it’s degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don’t want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently.

post,xt2kyc,,"Refresh X has AP limited to 85mph but DOES NOT require auto brights, new hardware?","We just picked up a 2022 refresh Model X earlier this week and noticed that when activating AP (FSD purchased but we are not in the beta), we are limited to a max auto-steer speed of 85 MPH (expected for Tesla vision), but auto-brights are not enabled automatically (unexpected). The X is on FW  2022.23.101.2 (updated from 2022.23.101.1 from the factory). 

This is in contrast to our Model 3 (on 2022.20.9) which is also limited to 85 MPH but always enables auto-brights automatically.

Wondering if this post ([ might have some truth to it. Or maybe this is just expected for refresh S and X due to better headlights or something?

I've confirmed repeatedly that auto-brights work normally when enabled, but do not turn on when enabling AP, and 85 MPH is definitely the auto-steer limit, so it wasn't a 1-off bug or anything.

post,xnwstk,,Tesla accessories I wish I didn’t buy,"So it seems like a common act of excitement to buy accessories during the long wait time while you're awaiting to receive your tesla. I think this is part due to youtubers pushing you towards that direction (because guess what they make money out of advertising for those sponsers!). So I'd like to list out the things I bought so that you don't make my mistake and burn all that cash. Before I go any further, I recommend not making the mistake I made and don't buy anything before you actually receive the car. Here's the list of things that I purchased, which ones I thought were worth it and which ones where not.

# Things I wish I didn't buy:

\- **[Center console cup holder cover]( I bought the baesenor ones off the amazon. Honestly, I don't know why people buy anything to cover there. There original space (without the cover) is not that big enough as you might think. So any type of covering (of any brand) would make it difficult to put your coffee cups and stuff in there. So you end up forcing the cup into the place and there is like 70% chance that doing this actually increases the chance of spilling coffee outside that area. Which defeats the entire purpose and messes up your entire interior. Just don't buy anything and your car looks more minimal and oem and you save money too!  
(If you insist of having some protection I would only put something for the floor of that cup area).

\- **[Magsafe phone mount]( I bought the Jowua phone mount, for a rip off price. Bought it directly off the Jowua website and while they said the shipping is free they didn't mention anywhere during the checkout that there was going to be a 25% (or any) customs being added after it shipped. I would never buy anything off of their official website, beware. Aside from that, as much as I loved and used the carplay in my previous car I have never used my phone itself once in tesla. It's just unintuitive, because the Tesla UI is just awesome and has everything you need, you also save on phone",1664134629.0,2022-09-25 21:37:09,225,259,No_Sandwich3888,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/xnwstk/tesla_accessories_i_wish_i_didnt_buy/,True,0.85,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,wmo24t,,EV Chargers at work,"I asked the mods if I could post this here, and they may take it down if it isn't up to Rule 2 standards. If so, I'll post in r/electricvehicles.

Recently, I was tasked with finding a charger to install at my workplace. There is only a single EV in the lot right now, and that is my Tesla Model 3. However, there are at least 2 Model Ys on order and a Cybertruck. So the company thought it's time to consider the future.

We didn't want to just get Tesla chargers, in case people come in with a Bolt or whatever. My requirements were J1772, have the ability to bill employees for charging, and not be public chargers that anyone off the street can use which also means it can't show up on a map.

My first stop was ChargePoint. They seem to be the standard when it comes to chargers. Looking at their website, they have the CPF50 which seems like the perfect option. Upon contacting them, I learn that the CPF50, a $2k charger, is software locked to a single car/account. That's stupid. So what else do they have? A large pedestal unit costing upwards of $15k for a dual charger. All because they made the decision to software lock the cheaper unit. Do companies seriously pay this? And then they were super dodgy when it came to the subscriptions and who actually owned the hardware.

So I found Enel X and the JuiceBox Pro. The sales guy I talked to over there was astounded at the fact that they wanted that much for a Level 2 charger. They thought it was a DC fast charger. So they came back with about $7,500 for 4 total chargers and the subscriptions necessary to set payment options. The entire setup we are looking for, half the cost of a single charger with ChargePoint. Ownership and subscriptions were also very clear. We own the hardware, $120/year subscription to get management and billing tools.

Personally, I feel we should just buy some cheaper wall mounted home chargers and call it a day. It'll cost less than $3,000 and we don't have to mess with any subscriptions.

What's yours?","Edit:  I'm honestly perplexed by the influx of downvotes.  Even if you're satisfied with Tesla as it exists today, wouldn't you want your (and others') experience to improve?  What is the downside to any of my suggested changes?

Edit 2:  Appears this post is a poster child for ""Sort by controversial.""  9K views, 50% up/downvoted.  I'd still like to hear why the downvoters disagree with what is recommended in the TL;DR.

\---------------------

To Whom it May Concern:

You sent me a survey to better understand my post-purchase vehicle satisfaction. I'm sure you'll be pleased to see that I am clearly still absolutely enthralled with my Model S even after almost 2 years of ownership.  To provide a balanced perspective, I felt it was important to also provide feedback on how I perceived your brand, peripheral support tools and services, as well as your various field service organizations.

To be clear, I am at least for now leaning towards NOT purchasing another Tesla as my next vehicle. My concerns are detailed below, and I'm sharing them because I believe Tesla still has an opportunity to change my leaning from ""likely not"" to ""likely yes,"" if steps are taken within the reasonable near term (e.g. 6-12 months).

What I’m looking for is a visible and authentic acknowledgment of the concerns (not just mine, but what you actually hear from your customers across the board, and what ""top 3"" issues or concerns emerge), along with a plan for addressing them. The best business is repeat business, and as things stand now from my vantage point, my and many others' repeat business is at serious risk.

Ok, so let's talk turkey.

Speaking only for myself, I have to be blunt. The Service Center experience (or, really, any experience that involves trying to speak with a real person during the buying or post-purchase process) is pretty terrible. It's a 1/10 in the ""something I have to do that isn't work or chores"" list, coming in just behind cleaning my pool filter.

post,wf2w53,,Service Mode left enabled - interesting details and non-customer errors.,"Picked up my car from the local Tesla-approved body shop after my AC was rather weak during the last few hot weeks. This was after a repaired front collision last year. When I picked it up it still had Service Mode on. I had this happen a few years ago (V9?) and the service mode also has come a long way. 

There is now a guided way to burnish the brakes. Car is set to zero regen (feels odd, particularly with my heavy Model X) you drive to 80km and brake down to almost 0 in a specified brake pressure window. Repeat 10 times with cooling down inbetween. All with on-screen guide. Sadly forgot to take screenshots. 

But there is also an extended alert list with issues not surfaced to the customer. 

Mine showed 2 active climate control alerts still present after the work (which they said consisted of filling in more gas as it was too low) and an ominous error relating to Pedal Monitoring. Quite curious why the car is missing a CAN node. 🧐

post,vpylzm,,Just installed Bio Defense Mode on my June 2021 Model Y,"I just finished adding in the parts and SW needed to enable Bio Defense Mode into my June 2021 build Model Y. From what I've read 2020 Model Ys don't have the needed Bolt Holes. 

**Needed Parts**

-REAR APRON, HEPA, MY(1619812-00-B) $ 26.00

-AIR INTAKE, MY(1499137-00-C) $ 10.00

-HEPA FILTER(149516700-B) $ 70.00

-2 M6 x 40mm bolts with a washer

**Ordering**

-Open the Tesla Mobile App

-Just set a Service Request under ""Other"" and request for those part #s

**Installation**

-Remove the existing cowl and tub

-Remove the original Air intake by removing the one bolt and lightly pulling it away from the Tesla

-Install the new air intake

-Install the HEPA Filter housing

-Reinstall the Model Y Tub and bolt it in

-Install the new Cowl

Software

-When asking the Tesla Tech about adding it he told me it wasn't something in their documentation, so they may say they can't do it. 

My tech told me he looked and saw a configuration option under the Model Y that he switched to HEPA, which caused my app to immediately show the BDM option under the climate menu. 

TLDR

-Bio Defense Mode added for $ 110 with tax and about 15 minutes of install time. 

-Totally worth it considering I thought it would be 500 like the Model X/S retrofit.",1656788388.0,2022-07-02 20:59:48,163,68,zer04evr,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/vpylzm/just_installed_bio_defense_mode_on_my_june_2021/,True,0.94,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,v8q1ux,,FSD Beta 10.12.2 – Write Up,"Today’s the first day I was able to do a good drive with FSD Beta 10.12.2.  Was a short trip though.

The trip was done in a 2017 Model X with AP 2.5 cameras.

As a whole there are improvements, and also not improvements.

[This was the route taken on the first drive](   Nothing super adventurous.

I intentionally drove past [this spot](  because, since 10.3 or 10.4, an issue developed where the car would slow down from 30mph to 15 when approaching the islands in the middle of the road.  That issue has been resolved.

When reaching the end of the road, [this intersection](  the car jerked back and forth a bit before settling on turning right.  It’s an understandable issue because the road dips a smidge as you drive alone, and the lane markers shown which lane goes left, and which one goes right, is basically seen “at the last moment” by the vehicle.  This has been an issue since 10.2, *however*, it has been smoothed out in 10.12.2.

At [the next intersection](  the intersection has been reconfigured since the satellite footage was taken.  They’ve added an extra lane to the right for “Straight and right” driving, that’s indicated by the black divided by a yellow marking, and the white arrows.  The green markings on the north side of the intersection is a new concrete divider that was put in.  These intersection changes have been ongoing, and started *after* the most recent map update by Tesla.  The intersection itself was reconfigured in December/January, and the concrete divider was added in the last two weeks.  *Historically, since December/January, the vehicle would pull out and make the left turn clipping over the yellow markings on the road, looked sloppy.  This time it handled smoothly, and accounted for the new concrete divider.  It also managed to do this while the light was yellow, which was also impressive.

Further north is another [fun intersection](   When traveling north the left hand most lane is a “left hand turn only” lane, with the center lane bring",1654806424.0,2022-06-09 22:27:04,31,15,Nakatomi2010,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/v8q1ux/fsd_beta_10122_write_up/,True,0.75,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Today we are discussing a Roadster destined for the scrapyard, to be rendered into badly needed parts, that was saved at the last moment...  Due to miscalculations by early Tesla, believing a Lotus Elise body could be electrified, they later realized frame changes and new body panels had to be created to accommodate a 1000 lb battery and electric drive train.  Only 7% of todays Roadsters share any Lotus parts, and with a small production run of only 2400 Roadsters, very few remaining vendors are still making original parts anymore, so the few donor or collision damaged Roadsters that become available, are in high demand for parts cars.  This is a story of a rescued Roadster. Enjoy.

The Roadsters in our Service Center are suffering from similar problems, so we decided to dig in and seek cause and solutions.  We are even working on a PEM modification which was designed by early Tesla pioneers seeking to make the Roadster less sensitive to heat.  This undocumented engineering change was uncovered by us during an early, low VIN, signature Roadster PEM rebuild.

post,1f1ozpe,,"Canada EV Tariffs, will this impact Canadian Tesla prices/incentives?","There may be a paywall for this article so please find it here:

Canada will impose new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, aluminum and steel, lining up behind western allies and taking steps to protect domestic manufacturers.
The government plans to announce a 100% levy on electric cars and 25% on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because the matter is still private. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to unveil the policy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he’s gathered with the rest of his cabinet for a series of meetings about the economy and foreign relations.
Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products. Canada’s auto sector is heavily integrated with that of its closest neighbor: The vast majority of its light vehicle production — which was 1.5 million units last year — is exported to the US.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful person in Trudeau’s cabinet, has been one of the most prominent voices in favor of a harder approach to Chinese vehicle exports, and becoming a closer trade ally with the US.

In June, she announced a public consultation on possible measures to make it more difficult for Chinese companies to sell electric vehicles in the Canadian market. The auto industry, she said, is “facing unfair competition from China’s intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity that is undermining Canada’s EV sector’s ability to compete.”

post,1dsjrlp,,Replicate a hand-free trunk with iOS Shortcuts and NFC tags,"*With an iPhone, Apple’s Shortcuts app, and an NFC tag, you can make pretty much any Tesla have a hands-free\* trunk by following this guide.  Scroll to the end if you are already familiar with iOS Shortcuts and want the quick setup guide.*

My 2023 Long Range Model Y unfortunately does not work with Tesla’s recent hands-free trunk feature since the Model Y lacks the UWB hardware.  However, I replicated similar behavior (within a window of time), and wanted to share how in case someone else would find it useful.  The only downside is that you need to roughly estimate how long it will take you to walk to your Tesla.  The NFC tag on the Tesla is also pretty ugly, but at the same time helps you pick out your white Tesla among the 10 others in the parking lot haha.

\* This is hands-free once you've reached your Tesla within the chosen time window, but requires you to first manually run the shortcut. This can be useful if you know you are about to head to your Tesla with your hands full and don't already have access to Siri via an Apple Watch or AirPods.



**You will need:**

* An iPhone that supports background NFC reading (iPhone XR/XS and later)
* Apple’s [Shortcuts app](
* NFC tags - [Amazon link](
* A Tesla that supports opening the trunk with the Tesla app and iOS Shortcuts
* A custom shortcut I created called [Hands Free Trunk](

**Detailed Setup Guide:**

*If you are already familiar with iOS shortcuts, see my quick setup guide at the bottom.*

* Stick an NFC tag onto your Tesla at a height where the top of your iPhone lines up with the tag while in your pocket.  *Note: the NFC tags I listed do not work when placed on metal.  So you will need to place the tag on a section of the Tesla that is plastic, like the bumper.  There are NFC tags that do work on metal that you can purchase instead.*
* Make sure you have the [Shortcuts app]( installed on your iPhone.
* [Enable third party shortcuts]( so you can install the shortcut I created.  See below for how this shor",1719806241.0,2024-07-01 05:57:21,21,19,AlfredNoldo,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1dsjrlp/replicate_a_handfree_trunk_with_ios_shortcuts_and/,True,0.72,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ec1at4,,Model 3 stinky odor from ac,"Hi Mr musk,

I purchase my model 3 back in feb 2019. First of all I love this car. It’s like opening a Christmas present with each updates. My only downfall with my model 3 is the ac odor. Five months after the odor became annoying bad. It smells like someone shit in the car. I ask for repair, Tesla send a tech to do foam treatment. The strong fragrance from the foam helps the smell for two weeks and the stinky smell is back again. I usually have to turn on my ac ten min before I get in the car to get rid off the smell. My two years old daughter refused to ride in my model 3. She prefers my old car, now is mommy’s car, 2011 Toyota Camry. Mommy car is not as fancy but it doesn’t smell like poo. My daughter would cry is her car seat because of the smell. So I decided to call Tesla again to repair my ac once for all. The Tesla decided to do the foam treatment AGAIN and charge me for 200 of two week smell of fragrance, which I think it’s a scam. If there is a design problem please admit and fix it. Doesn’t matter if internal circulation or external circulation explanation from your tech, this shouldn’t happen at all. At least my 2011 Toyota doesn’t have this problem, but my 2019 tesla model 3 has it. I am sick of ignorance from the tech. May god bless Tesla and continue to impress me and the world of gasoline that change is here.",1576614005.0,2019-12-17 21:20:05,5,7,fishbone1314,Musk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Musk/comments/ec1at4/model_3_stinky_odor_from_ac/,True,1.0,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,oadr50,,"0-60 doesn't tell the full story, let's put Plaid Model S's 60-130mph time in perspective.","On the surface, a 1.99-2.2s (depends on how you measure it) 0-60mph time is absurdly quick, but doesn't seem like a material leap from 2.2-2.4s achieved by previous record holders (918 Spyder, Model S Performance, Taycan Turbo S, etc). 

But what Tesla truly achieved with the Plaid powertrain is how much quicker it is at higher speed acceleration. So I'm doing a short list of comparing the Plaid Model S to some of the quickest accelerating cars ever built in history, EV and ICE alike. 

Note: I used magazine test time whenever possible for all the cars below, and drag strip timeslips if magazine test numbers are not available, and finally user submitted Draggy/Vbox times (this is when it gets unreliable).

Test: 60-130mph

2011 Ferrari F1: [~2.6s]( (purely for reference, current F1 cars are much faster even, but I can't find data).

2021 Rimac Nevera: [3.39s]( **Lol WTF BBQ, I guess sets a target for the future Roadster to beat**

2021 Bugatti Chiron Sport: [4.1s]( (I don't think we'll see a pure ICE production car exceeding this ever again).

2021 McLaren 765LT (ECU tune): [4.16s]( (only non-stock car on this list, but the modification is minimal and only shows how much McLaren sandbagged their turbo cars like usual).

**2021 Tesla Plaid Model S**: [4.71s](

2021 McLaren 765LT (stock):  [4.76s]( 

2013 McLaren P1: [4.8s]( (this was mind bogglingly fast when it came out 8 years ago)

2021 Ferrari SF90: [4.97s](

2013 Ferrari LaFerrari: [5s]( 

2017 McLaren 720S: [5.37s]( (for a mainstream supercar, this was a performance landmark when it first came out 4 years ago)

2020 Ferrari F8: [6.21s](

2021 Porsche 992 911 Turbo S: [6.7s](

**2019 Porsche Taycan Turbo S**: [8.1s]( (the previous king of production EVs)

**2020 Tesla Model S Performance (Raven)**: [9.4s]( (This is why people called the old Model S a one trick pony of 0-60. It wasn't competitive against actual ICE performance cars back then).

**2018 Model 3 Performance (Pre-power boost)**:  [13.1s](

post,mueyt8,,Test drove a Taycan 4S - Disappointed compared to Tesla!,"I currently drive a 2019 Tesla Model 3 LR AWD as a daily driver and although I love the car, I wanted something a bit more unique, but with the same ""electric driving experience."" What this means to me is smooth, fast, effortless acceleration.

A little about me: I race cars and motorcycles at the track (expert level), so I have a good feel for cars and bikes. I've owned BMW M-cars for about 20-years before switching to Tesla. Now, everything other than electric (on the street) feels kind of clunky. Speaking only of daily drivers, not 'weekend/track' type cars.

I went to the Porsche dealer to check out the Taycan 4S with a starting MSRP of \~$104k and this one was optioned out to around $135k. As you may ascertain by the title, it was very disappointing. The car is beautiful to look at, I was drooling over it and was ready to order one. However, the driving experience left much to be desired.

The steering was a bit sloppy compared to my Model 3. The accelerator wasn't as 'connected' to my right foot. It wasn't as smooth as I expected it to be. The car has a transmission and you can feel it. There are downshifts when you step on the accelerator. Transition between no throttle and part throttle was choppy, like a non-electric. Regen was weak to non-existent. I couldn't figure out a way to disable creep mode. When reverse-parking, visibility out the back was bad and the backup camera was so warpy, it was practically useless. In a $100k+ car, that's inexcusable!

post,lrsqoo,,Tesla Does Not Cover Unexpected Vehicle Noises Under Warranty,"Hi all! I wanted to leave some information here regarding my experience with Tesla Service.  


I have had my Tesla Model 3 Performance since August 2018 (back when they were selling for \~$78K fully loaded). I brought my car in for service numerous times primarily for cosmetic issues but occasionally for rattles and noises. In the past they tried addressing the noises and were partially successful.  


Recently some of the rattling noises have become more pronounced and annoying. After making a service appointment I was told that noises are not covered under warranty and I would have to pay out of pocket to have them addressed. Tesla said any work done to fix noises in the past was a courtesy.  


I am shocked that a luxury car brand would act this way. I love my Tesla but am becoming increasingly frustrated with quality and customer service.

post,ro2y36,,I think the holiday update is a step backwards in design and functionality. Do you agree?,"I just got the Holiday update with FSD Beta, and in the span of a few minutes, I gathered the following reasons why I don't like the UI at all. I not only think it looks like a rushed design overhaul with mismatched color schemes, icon designs, and inconsistencies, this update actually has taken away a lot of conveniently located items and buried them in menus, thereby sacrificing functionality and efficiency.

I have enumerated my reasons here and the link below references images.

[

1. The icons are childish and unpolished. Someone else had said the icons look like they were designed by a 3rd year old. I agree. The colors remind me of off-brand phone OS, and there is inconsistencies in icon design. In the old build, the icon bar at the bottom nicely blended with the rest of the UI and the icons weren't vibrantly blinding you with colors. They were quietly sitting there blending with the rest of the UI! I really don't like this, as you might be able to tell from the emotions, haha! 
2. The speedometer is terribly small and horribly positioned in the leftmost corner. In certain driving positions, your right hand can block the view of it. What was wrong with it large, bolded, and centered?
3. Checking trip information was easy and one slide away. Why is it now buried in the menus?
4. Same as in 3. but for tire pressure.
5. When you pull up from the bottom of the screen, no matter where you begin from, the HVAC controls come up. This seems like a waste of gestures in functionality. For example, it was nice that in the previous builds, we could get different music player UIs by sliding up and down on the icon.
6. The full-screen FSD Beta visualization is *nice*, but it should not have replaced the semi full-screen view. I loved the 2/3 1/3 split between Beta and maps because it gave me the best view of what Beta was seeing and about to do and what the next maneuver was based on map data. I don't really see the point of this full-screen view. I don't trust Beta enough ",1640408809.0,2021-12-25 06:06:49,1309,634,Nexus9291,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ro2y36/i_think_the_holiday_update_is_a_step_backwards_in/,True,0.86,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,rfgdl2,,FSD 10.6.1 - Curbed it,"Just had my first *brief* drive on FSD 10.6.1, it has some improvements over 10.5, however, there's some regression as well.

2017 Model X w/ AP 2.5 cameras.

It was dark out.

Unfortunately the drive did not get off to a great start.  [One of the first turns]( it had to take, it put me in a position to curb it.  This intersection gave 10.2 issues, but it got better after 10.2, with 10.5 handling it perfectly, including at night.  Today it choked in the middle of the intersection and I took control, however, there was a vehicle behind me and I didn't have enough maneuvering room to correct how bad the angle of the turn was, so I ended up running over the curb with my driver side tires, both of them.  Thankfully, I guess, it was more of a ""head on"" curbing than a side swiping one, so there's no damage to the vehicle.  **To be clear**, *I the driver* curbed it while in control of the car.  FSD Beta just put me in a position where that's what happened when I took control.  I was further to the left than I thought I was, and this intersection has worked fine for a couple versions now.  Normally when I intervene there's room for the course correction.  FSD Beta lined me up badly, but I was in control at the time of curbing.  FYI, [this is the curb in question]( which is a not a bad one to drive over.  But still, not fun.

The next few intersections were just straight throughs, it handled those fine.

[This intersection here]( though there was an improvement.  Prior to 10.5 this on ramp was handled fine.  10.5 used to try to come to a complete stop at the yellow line, however, 10.6.1 no longer does this anymore, so that's a welcome improvement.

When getting off of aa highway I got to [this intersection]( where the vehicle needed to follow the red line, but followed the yellow one instead, ultimately trying to put me in the turn lane, which was not what needed to happen there.

post,pm4la3,,To those considering aftermarket versus OEM cabin filter (and installation tips),"Back in stock finally, so I bought myself a pair of [Breathe Easy]( cabin filters. They have been a preferred option over the OEM Tesla filter and also slightly beat out the XTechnor HEPA ones too according to [this source]( ([Teslamotors thread]( but the proof is in the pudding, so I thought I'd add my two cents:

First impressions weren't too great since although they looked similar to the [OEM Model 3 filter]( and the measurements were the same (24.5cm x 14.2cm), the weight was somewhat lighter than the stock OEM Model 3 filters (146 grams versus 210 grams). However, I spent a few hours today in fairly heavy traffic, and there was almost nothing in the way of exhaust fumes (and I'm sensitive to them because I really hate such fumes). I was behind numerous lorries/semis in stop and go traffic. Nothing. There was just a whiff lasting around a second when I was behind a motorcycle for a few minutes, but other than that, I was very impressed by the lack of fumes entering the car. Don't think I'll need recirculation mode again.

After looking around at various videos, I found [this video]( and [this video]( to have the best lighting/angles to see what was properly going on to help with installation. Took me about 1-2 hours.

Finally, the infamous hard to access torque screw lived up to its infamous reputation, being not just hard to reach, but hard to ***even see***. Had to get a torch and dip my head right in there to see what I was looking at. [This tool]( ([UK version]( however was a lifesaver and super cheap. Previously, I tried a small 90 degree ratchet wrench and didn't have much luck. But this small ***ratcheted*** screwdriver measuring just [80mm long]( was super handy in reaching in such a confined space. It holds bits, so you need to buy the appropriate torque bit ([T20]( I believe, but you should really get a set of torque bits - super cheap!), but it's such a handy tool to have anyway because it supports other bits too.

post,nnbdk1,,SF to LA this weekend - I5 vs 101? Which is better for charging stall availability?,"Driving SF to LA tomorrow, and coming back later in the week. I would prefer the 101 just because it's more scenic and interesting (and fewer semi trucks) and appears to only add 30-45 minutes to the trip. I have a LR Model 3.

I see there is a high-speed station on the 101 in Greenfield. It has half as many stalls as the Firebaugh one on the I5, but I've heard the I5 stations tend get very busy and have a wait, especially during holiday weekends. Case in point, when I look at the Tesla Trip Planner website it doesn't even show the Firebaugh station as an option, so I'm guessing that means it currently has no stalls available.

So does anyone have some insight they'd be willing to share? Is there usually a wait at the Greenfield high-speed station on a Saturday? Should I stick to the I5? Will there be long lines since it's Memorial Day?

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

***EDIT: Updating this thread for future readers, in case it proves valuable. We ended up taking the 101 route both directions (heading south early on a Saturday morning, back north on a Wednesday afternoon). It did take about an hour longer than it would on the I5, but to me it was completely worth it. Supercharging was not an issue - there are plenty of v3 stations in Greenfield, Paso Robles, Goleta, Santa Barbara and at East Katella Ave in Anaheim which is close to Disneyland. Traffic was much lighter than what I've experienced on the I5, especially commercial traffic, and the scenery was fantastic for most of the drive, especially compared to the desolate, boring, fatiguing terrain of*** ***~~Mordor~~*** ***I5.

post,n053mz,,Leaving Tesla unplugged,"Model Y unplugged

Hello again, I have read many many articles and I’m just not finding a direct answer. Please read the entire post before commenting.

I am in the market for a long range model Y. This is my current situation. I drive a semi truck. I keep my current vehicle inside of an enclosed storage unit that is not climate controlled. It is not directly exposed to the elements however it will be exposed to ambient air temperature. In Iowa you can sometimes reach -10°, but it is not very often.

I DO NOT, in any way shape or form have a way to plug in this vehicle while I am on the road for up to 36 days straight. Usually it is only around 24 days. That means I do not have a household plug, I cannot have one installed inside of the storage unit and there are no solar panels. I know I am being very specific, but each time I mention I do not have a way to plug it in someone mentions plug it into a household outlet. 

I have read where people leave their vehicle unplugged parked at an airport for two weeks and come back with very minimal battery loss. If I charge up to 90% and turn everything off and only check the car once per week through the app should I be able to come back with sufficient battery to make it to the nearby supercharger even in the winter?

Edit: I do not have anyone who can charge it for me. It is just me. Me myself and I. And I do not have a lightbulb socket either.",1619577826.0,2021-04-28 04:43:46,20,110,icodyonline,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/n053mz/leaving_tesla_unplugged/,True,0.69,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,mjk8vu,,3 Months of FSD just expired. How was it?,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to post my experience with FSD while I was able to use the 3 free months, since I picked up my car on December 30th. I just wanted to use this post to document my experiences and figure out if it's something I would consider purchasing in the future. I know many more updates will be pushed as time goes on, but this is just how it was for me for the past 3 months.

Let's begin with the things I pretty much didn't even use, and work up from there. I'll be leaving the standard Autopilot out of this list because every Tesla comes with it. If Autopilot didn't come with the car, I'd be buying FSD all the way just for that alone.

**Auto-Park:**

It sounds very convenient, but I didn't get the option to use it as intended once. What I mean by that, is the only time I ever got the option come up to use it was when there was a sidewalk connected to a driveway, and I was pulled into the driveway. It pretty much thought the sidewalk was a parking spot. It is what it is, but I wish I could've at least seen this feature once. I pulled up to spots to parallel park, spots where there was a gap, even normal parking spots in between two cars, but nothing ever popped up for me to initiate autopark.

**Navigate on Autopilot:**

This one I was particularly excited to try out. Unfortunately though, the first couple experiences I've had with it weren't very good. I drive on highways that don't have a whole lot of people on it, even at their busiest. I think the 2nd time I used it, it initiated the turn signal to get back into the right lane, while I was only a couple feet in front of a semi, which made the semi driver freak out a tad :/ After that, I just didn't feel too comfortable using it to automatically pass cars. It's nice to see what the future holds for fully autonomous driving, but that experience was just a little too crazy for me to try it and rely on it more.

post,mbetme,,Serious: What is Tesla's exposure if FSD doesn't make it to owner's hands?,"This might not be the right forum, but I'm curious if anyone has done a semi-academic study of the legal and financial exposure to Tesla and perhaps Elon himself if the FSD continues to push? I understand that is a complicated question because Tesla itself isn't overly forthcoming and the reasons for pushing could vary wildly from bugs to government intervention.

I'm often chastised by other owners for taking a serious rather than optimistic view on the company, but it seems to me that the FSD presales constitute a contractual obligation for a specific set of features and that at some point the failure to deliver on those promises is a breach of contract subject to not just refunds, but perhaps penalties and other legal action.

I bring this up because I've spent the last two days in heated debate over Ford's ""vaporware"" comment with others in the community that take a more optimistic (perhaps apologetic) view point and it concerns me deeply that the ongoing delays are no longer just a customer service issue and matter of irritation for those of us early adopters, but perhaps a very real liability and risk to the company. It also seems like an opportunity for competitors (I'm thinking more GM than Ford) to sling mud and make it stick, putting brand trustworthiness in the market in jeopardy.

I welcome all honest and thoughtful comments. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Updates: I'm updating here rather than inline to provide additional questions in an easy to find location.

Update 1:

I've seen a lot of arguments here and other places that Tesla has no exposure legally due to the purchase contract wording. I assert this is patently false. While Elon's public comments don't have the same legal weight as original contracts, as head of the company he has legal obligations to conduct himself as an honest representative of the company in both a marketing and a shareholder fiduciary level (read shareholder legal action, not buyer).

post,m9pm1r,,USB music on Tesla,"I put a bunch of music on an SD card in the Tesla, and was pretty disappointed with the player.  No cover art, no search, no history.  Some of these lacks used to work, and I'm assuming they may in the future.  But there is one thing that would be nice, and I'm not sure if it's broken, or never worked, or I'm doing it wrong.

It's the genres tag.  Much of my music has multiple genres, and my collection separates them using semi-colons, although I also tried commas.  But the Tesla just interprets it as one genre, such as rock;blues rather than rock and blues.  My phone's player does it correctly, so I think the tags are what they should be.

Does anyone even use USB music these days, and know how to either make it work or whether it's ever going to work.  The thing about USB is it can sound much better than bluetooth or streaming music, and it's nice to have anyway.

post,m8731w,,The Tesla saved my family’s lives TWICE in one day,"Preface: This car impresses the hell out of me. I’m a pretty skilled driver, racing training etc, and still this thing outperforms my insights and reflexes. Many times it’s wrong, but sometimes it’s not...

Road trip with my two kids from Reno to Vegas. Highway 95 is a 2-lane road well traveled by slow trucks. Drivers tend to get agitated and make daring passing maneuvers. 

I have FSD, but I’m not sure how much of this was just normal autopilot. Since it’s not a divided highway, the autonav was not active. Just auto steer. 

The first incident, I was glancing down at the screen when suddenly the brakes slammed on and every mortal alarm sounded. I looked up just in time to see the oncoming car dive back into its lane, narrowly missing a head on collision with us. The Tesla braking gave the other driver enough time to get back over. Had the Tesla not braked, who knows... Granted, definitely a case of distracted driver, I’m not perfect and this time would have mattered. We said “whoa” and started laughing like you do when you just told Death “Not today!” and it worked. 

The second incident was fucking sobering and also really made me grateful. This time, it was an impatient semi that wanted to pass another semi. I saw this one coming, but the Tesla reacted first. Every mortal alarm goes off as two semis are barreling at me, taking up the whole road. My reflexes are pretty fast but the Tesla was faster. It slammed on the brakes HARD and avoided to the right, crossing over the rumble strip and seeking cover on the shoulder of the road. It all happened so quickly that it took me a few moments to review things in my mind and realize “wait...I didn’t do all that”

Tl;dr - Not Today

Edit: thanks for all the comments. I wonder now if both of these situations could also have been handled more cooperatively. For example, normally when you see someone doing a passing maneuver and it’s obvious they’re cutting it close, you’ll slow down or make room some other way.

post,m7zx0d,,Looks like FSD Beta 8.2 has one specific bug (with Evidence),"Long story short, the car colors the bounding boxes for other cars it sees. It uses different colors based on what category they fall into, and 8.2 seems to be miscategorizing cross traffic.

Purple is used to mark cars crossing your path, and Yellow is used to mark traffic going the opposite direction that you shouldn't have to interact with (Often people think the car doesn't see this traffic, but it's usually just the yellow on white being hard to see).

Yellow cars don't seem to be taken into account when planning a path.

It seems that FSD Beta 8.2 has a bug where it sometimes incorrectly labels cross-traffic (that should be purple) as yellow.

Here are a bunch of timestamps where it happens:

**From one of** u/chazman92**'s videos**

[4:00](  Cars are incorrectly marked yellow. Car unsafely proceeds

[5:05]( Cars are marked yellow with one purple but the rest yellow. Maybe an early disengagement here.

[5:43]( All cars are correctly purple. The car proceeds safely.

[6:54]( Cars are purple, and one is too far back for AP to consider it. Safe turn.

post,m5uhfw,,Model 3 Road Trip Thoughts,"Just my thoughts on how my Model 3 did on a recent long road trip.

**Details:** 

2018 Model 3 LR RWD. \~2,000 miles on I-40, I-44, I-70 over 6 driving days, 4-6 hours of driving per day. Hotels every night except for a 2 day stay with family in the middle. Wife drove separately in an ICE, one toddler in each car plus a dog in the ICE.

**Overall Experience:** 

Great! By far the easiest cross-country road trip I’ve ever done. Autopilot is a massive help. Charging forced us to make more periodic stops which was honestly beneficial to everyone involved. After 2 years of ownership and only 6,000 miles on the car due to a short commute and no big trips, I hadn’t often experienced range anxiety. The first couple days of this trip it really kicked in. Watching the estimated battery percentage at destination vary so much freaked me out a bit. But every leg of the trip the battery percentage ended up higher at arrival than originally predicted despite it often dropping precipitously early into the leg, so I got over it pretty quick. I did still try to keep my SoC above 15% for peace of mind though, and spending an extra 5 or 10 minutes at each charger wasn’t a big deal.

**Charging:**

Most days we stopped to charge twice, and we managed to only need to use Tesla Superchargers (though we also plugged in to a standard wall outlet while staying with family). Total cost was $111, but one charging stop was free as I was driving through Texas. Most locations were decent, though a couple felt slightly sketchy. They were usually near a gas station which was convenient for us. All had restrooms accessible within a reasonable walk, and most had some semblance of restaurant close by. One interesting hiccup was that in one area my wife was filling with gas, I was charging and went to walk for food, but only drive-thrus were open due to COVID, so we had to wait for her to finish filling up to get food. Without a second vehicle we would’ve had to interrupt charging or pick food up aft",1615841276.0,2021-03-15 21:47:56,102,47,aaanold,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m5uhfw/model_3_road_trip_thoughts/,True,0.88,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,18m38qb,,Toyota Industries to Increase Supply to Tesla by 2.5 Times for EV-Use Electric Compressors,"Translated from japanese

Toyota Industries will expand its supply of electric compressors for electric vehicle (EV) air conditioners to Tesla. The company has a 70% share of the market for this component in Tesla vehicles, and it expects to ship 2.5 times as many units in 2026 as it did in 2022, for a total of about 2.5 million units. Toyota is also working to strengthen its production base to meet the growing demand from European and American automakers that are leading the EV market.

According to interviews with industry insiders, electric compressors are the heart of car air conditioners, which regulate the temperature inside the car. The compressor compresses the refrigerant, making it hot, and then expands it, creating cold air. In electric vehicles (EVs), electric compressors also play a role in cooling the battery and heating the cabin, and they are required to have high performance.

Toyota Industries provides electric compressors for Tesla's main sedan, the Model 3, as well as the versatile sports utility vehicles (SUVs) Model Y and Model X. While Tesla began shipping its electric pickup truck, the Cybertruck, at the end of November, Toyota lost a bidding competition for supplying components for that model. Despite this setback, they are intensifying efforts to secure contracts for other vehicle models by actively promoting their electric compressors.

Tesla's 2022 electric vehicle (EV) production increased 47% from the previous year to approximately 1.37 million units. Tesla plans to introduce new models and expand its factories in the future. S&P Global Mobility, a research firm, estimates that Tesla's production will reach 3.65 million units in 2026. Toyota's shipments of electric compressors to Tesla were approximately 1 million units in 2022, but are expected to expand to approximately 2.5 million units in 2026.

In response to the global shift to electrification, Toyota Industries is strengthening its production base for electric compressors.

Importantly, if I lived somewhere other than where I am now, I might have made a different choice. I lived in San Diego for quite a few years, and now live in western Mass. Might have made different choices if I was still in SD.

What we looked at/drove:

1a. Hyundai Ioniq 5. The first to look at... we didn't drive it the first time because my husband veto'd it. He thought it was too small (it's not) and was still not sold on 100% electric. More on this later.

1b. We also looked at the Santa Fe PHEV at the same dealer. The trim felt a bit cheap, but I wasn't really serious about it because I knew I would eventually win the all EV battle. 

2. Volkswagen ID.4. Also didnt drive. I liked the look of it, husband didn't like the trim. For a small SUV/crossover, the trunk seemed a bit small for golf clubs. Dealership seemed really invested in selling EVs - they had a EV specialist that was busy when we were there, but even the non-specialist seemed very well informed. Husband was still holding out for PHEV, so he might have just been grumpy when we looked at it.

3. Nissan Ariya. First one I drove, took out the FWD version. More than any other car, it felt like an ICE. Both in the interior appointments (which maybe some folks like) but also in the driving feel. Sure, it was zippyier than our ICE, but I expected a bit more and was kinda disappointed. I suspect the AWD might have felt better. A rare FWD instead of RWD for an EV non-AWD version. No ""real"" one pedal driving. I wasn't sold for these reasons....
(The very young salesman did tell us a nice story during our drive about how last summer he hitchhiked all through western Mass because he was growing weed in the forest). 

4. Ford Mustang Mach e AWD. I really liked this car. A lot. Really, really a lot. It was definitely the experience I expected and wanted from an EV while driving.

For comparisons, here are latest videos from the tech giants Huawei and Baidu. Huawei's HDmap-less drive demo was on protected highways of its primary city Shanghai. No indication yet if Huawei is capable to taking mapless to city streets.

&#x200B;

Baidu operates robotaxi with those giant lidars just like Waymo in US. However, without the large lidar or HDmap, its demo of its first EV is pretty bad. The route is an easy suburb one, nowhere near the most complex city center streets.

&#x200B;

These two tech giants with tens of thousands of AI engineers are still struggling in a suburb of one city. XPeng's NGP is available for users in 29 cities, soon 54. 

Still don't believe XPeng is the one champion? VW bought into XPeng for its tech. VW EVs designed by XPeng will be launched next year. Tesla's FSD will be facing VWs with NGP in US in the near future. Didi, Uber of China, is partnering with XPeng too, guaranteeing 360k units sales of XPeng's Mona EV models over two years to take 5% shares of XPEV. Why would a ridehail operator guarantee EV sales? Because they will purchase units themselves for robotaxi operations. Finally, NVDA is partnering with XPeng, designing vehicle AI chips just for XPeng, which has requested less powerful and expensive chips. XPeng's software is so good that it can start to cut hardware costs. CEO of NVidia, Jensen, personally visited XPeng to receive head of NGP for a VP position in Nvidia.

For six years it was a Tesla raffle; last year it started as a Tesla raffle but we added Rivian R1T and R1S options mid-stream, though the winner chose a Model X. This year I may be a bit crazy to be offering any EV, but we had feedback that people wanted more options than just Teslas and Rivians. There are some restrictions, the most important being the price and delivery date (we need to close out the raffle within our fiscal year):

1. The vehicle must be a fully battery-powered electric vehicle, not a hybrid or plug-in hybrid.
2. It must be a new vehicle offered for sale direct from the manufacturer or by a brand-authorized dealer.
3. Its price must fit within the Prize Vehicle Payout of $112,835, or the winner must pay any overage; in no case will Climate XChange pay above the Prize Vehicle Payout.
4. It must be readily available for delivery, so that the transaction can take place and payment from Climate XChange can be completed by June 30, 2024. If it is apparent on June 15, 2024 that this deadline cannot be met, the prize will default to the Alternate All-Cash Prize of $100,000.

I had some minor issues with it over time, but honestly it was one of the most exciting, fun and reliable vehicles I've ever driven. *No, I will not be discussing charging infrastructure here because I haven't yet roadtripped in the Air -- but the range, so far, in the Air seems REAL and ACCURATE, vs the MYP.*

--

My main complaints with the MYP were the EXTREMELY uncomfortably hard sport suspension and the increasingly hazardous support infrastructure at Tesla where getting in touch with a human and/or scheduling appointments was awful.  Also I'm not an Elon fan, but that wasn't a make-or-break.

In the run up to end of lease, I tried to buy a used 2021 Model S LR+, I wanted the luxury and increased range, and it felt like a safe bet cost-wise though it was probably higher than I wanted to put down with interest rates and all.  I paid money to ship it to the east coast from the west coast, plus a small deposit.  The week before delivery, Tesla dropped new vehicle prices for the S and X.  This absolutely torpedoed the value of the car I'd just spent money sending to the east coast.  Long story short, Tesla is VERY non-communicative and I ended up walking away from it.

In my search for another car, I stumbled across the latest round of lower lease prices being offered by Lucid on the Air Pure -- being in the northeast, I wanted AWD and all told it checked all the same boxes the Model S did but it was (1) new; (2) more beautiful; (3) longer range; (4) featured better quality materials.  After some negotiation, I came away paying less for it monthly than I did the MYP.

My experience with Lucid has been as follows:

1. Unlike Tesla, they are HUNGRY.  They are responsive, their team is on standby and will reply even by text message -- personally.  They are friendly and follow through and are thorough.

2.

post,16wzsc4,,EV Price Premium Tracker (US market) - Q3 2023 update,"After the good reception to this spreadsheet / doc last month, and because I also could use a new hobby, I have decided to continue developing the **EV Price Premium Tracker**, with updates at the end of every quarter!

# [

The **EV Price Premium Tracker**, formerly the ""EV Price Parity Scorecard"", is an ongoing spreadsheet that shows the differences in MSRP between EVs and ICE vehicles in the same segment, from the same brand, configured to as close to feature parity as possible.

New for the Q3 2023 update are sheets comparing the EV pricing of ""modern OEMs"" such as Tesla, Rivian, and Fisker, with ICE models from both mainstream and premium segments. In addition, for all sheets, I have identified which model year's pricing / configuration is being compared. Finally, I have added info for many single-motor RWD model variants, as that was lacking before.

\--

At the current stage of the EV transition, there are three categories of ""class parity"" among vehicles from the same brand:

* EVs that are directly based off of existing ICE models (or the other way around). This includes the Volvo XC40 Recharge and the BMW i4.
* EVs that are their own models / platforms compared to ICEs, but that share the same naming structure and market positioning. This includes the Mercedes EQS SUV versus the GLS, the Audi Q8 e-Tron versus the Q8, and the Chevrolet Blazer EV versus the Blazer ICE.
* EVs that have no direct equivalent but can be matched with an equivalent ICE in the brand based on the body style, available features, and exterior and / or interior dimensions. Think a Nissan Ariya versus a Rogue (X-Trail), a Volkswagen ID.4 versus a Tiguan (LWB), an Audi e-Tron GT versus an A7, and the like. Most of the vehicles on the tracker are in this category.

For the tracker, I stuck to models that were as close to performance parity as possible, so there may be some notable omissions.

Also, I have not included any extra-cost paint colors, interior trim, or wheels in the comparison",1696163060.0,2023-10-01 14:24:20,40,14,lostinheadguy,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16wzsc4/ev_price_premium_tracker_us_market_q3_2023_update/,True,0.95,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,16obp0z,,Proper built-in charger routing while navigating,"Hello all,

I'm doing research for my next company which has to be an EV due to new policies in my country.

I don't necessarily have range anxiety as I know cars charge fast enough and chargers are popping up all over the place.

However, one point that is important for me is a proper built-in charger routing while I'm navigating to my destination.

I'm using Tesla as a benchmark here:  
\* Built-in navigation system routes you via Superchargers if you need to charge  
\* Shows you how many chargers are in use, etc.  
\* Has up to date information (as far as I'm aware) so that it shows latest chargers  
\* The car is preconditioning the battery when it knows it will arrive at a Supercharger within x minutes.  
\* Shows new roads quite early on. The same way Google Maps or Apple Maps work, so offers free navigation updates.

\--> Due to this, a separate app on your phone like ABRP is not necessary; also not after 1 year of use when other cars' navigation maps are outdated.

Note: the Tesla Model Y is just within my budget, so any cars that are significantly more expensive I don't want to include.  


As I'm living in Europe, most EV's have a CCS connector, so the car is not limited only to non-Superchargers or vise versa.

I'm also aware that Google Maps and now also Apple Maps can show current status at chargers, but cars are not preconditioning when using these apps.

Could someone advice me which other EV's offer the same or similar EV routing function?  
I just don't want to limit myself to a Tesla. I prefer them, but I don't want to regret it later on when it appears other vehicles are doing a better job.

post,16i9kpu,,"Tesla, or no EV’s in general?","Have been driving a bmw M3 as my daily driver the last 5 years - I’m 6 foot 7, wanted some room in the car, tried the X, S, Y…. I like speed, I got used to one pedal driving on my test drive (amazing) and I LOVE THE TECH in these cars. 

The amount of leg room, width and length … it’s amazing. 

However, I get a weird dizzy naseous feeling whenever I’m in the car. At any speed, at any setting. Creep, chill, etc. rented a model Y for 2 weeks, I’m one week in. I’m so naseous i can’t do much! 

I don’t notice “motion sickness” (if that’s what this is) any other times except when I’m going down in an airplane and my stomach drops and I’m usually a bit “out of it disoriented” for an hour after landing. Sort of like tesla, but when I drive it happens right away. 

I’m hoping someone tells me “your body will just get used to it, I was sick for a month before it got better” sort of thing. 

Any takers? Or is electric just not for me. (Or do I just need an S with the better suspension?).

post,16bnu6p,,"Explaining the CyberTruck’s Depressing Inspiration: As Rivian instills a sense of adventure, the CyberTruck wants to romanticize survival in a fictional cyberpunk dystopia","So, listen… I’m really not impressed with the CyberTruck overall. I think it’s really ugly, impractical, and sort of, well, dumb. While we don’t know many details about the production model, it will most likely be capable — even if there’s a lot wrong with its functionality (most egregiously its sloped bed walls). But what I can’t stop thinking about is what CyberTrucks stand for.

I can’t imagine how people are going to react to these on the road. The design is so divisive and like nothing we’ve seen since the ill-fated DeLorean. That design is so important to Elon Musk it delayed the launch of the truck because it had to be built out of stainless steel to achieve its design goals. This required new production methods never before seen and whole bunch of considerations. I’m starting with this because it shows that the design of the CT is more important than just about anything else. I firmly believe Tesla could have made an equally capable truck a hell of a lot faster by using traditional materials. But they didn’t. They couldn’t. The design language of the CT is what makes it so special to Elon.

I’m genuinely shocked that Tesla let (now-legitimate) rival Rivian take such a massive first mover advantage to achieve its design which is credited for long production delays. Rivian has tens of thousands of trucks on the road today an is targeting a total of 52k produced this year. Rivian is cornering the “capable EV truck” market more every quarter. Just today I was walking to my R1T when I heard a family say, “Oh wow, another Rivian. There are lots of those everywhere now.” We’ll come back to comparing Rivian and Tesla again later in this post, but it’s no secret that CyberTruck’s success depends on enough people buying it that passersbys start to say the same thing. Time will tell if that happens, but, if it does, I’m pretty bummed out based on what the CyberTruck’s represents and its inspirations.

So, what inspired such an… ugly truck?

post,15qreqy,,My 2 weeks ownership review of the BMW i4 eDrive35,"In my [previous post]( I discussed the decision making process that led to me leasing a BMW i4 eDrive35 as the replacement for my Model 3 Performance being my daily driver. So now I've officially owned the car for 2 weeks, here is what I think of it so far.

*Disclaimer*: This entire ""review"" is mostly based on my *personal* preferences and I evaluate the pros/cons based how it fits my current needs. Different people like different things so your milage may vary (pun intended).

**Exterior**: It's not the prettiest car on the road, but I do like how it looks for the side and the rear and even the front has grown on me a bit to no longer be offensive. I thought the [silver color]( was boring at first but I now really like it since it looks quite sleek and my Porsche is already [flashy enough]( The build quality is excellent and feels much more premium than the F30 BMW 335i I owned. Paint quality is fantastic and is in a different class than my old Model 3. Also I love silly details like the [light carpet]( 

**Powertrain - Performance**: First of all, this car is *a lot* slower than my Model 3. Now with that out of the way, just how slow is the slowest EV BMW sells at the moment? The answer is it's actually quite decent. BMW's official numbers are 282hp/295lb-ft/5.8s 0-60. In typical BMW fashion I suspect all those numbers are generously underrated and the car feels properly fast at speed up to 50mph. Launching at 0mph actually doesn't feel as fast as stomping the throttle at 30mph (which is fast enough to scare unsuspected passengers). My guess is it's related to RWD/traction control. At 50-80mph it's about as quick as an ICE BMW 330i/430i, but feels quicker due to the instant throttle response and silky sooth power delivery. At 80mph+ it's no longer quick and merely becomes *adequate*. All in all it won't impress anyone who's owned faster EVs but it's still faster than most things on the road, especially given how effortless and responsive it is.

post,15otjua,,Why not build more low-tech EVs?,"Manufacturers of electric cars always seem to be catering to futuristic rich techy crowd whenever a new one is announced, and it always makes me wonder why. If anyone were to design and sell an EV without all the bells and whistles of a Tesla or a Rivian, I would buy one immediately. 

I drive a 2008 Scion xB and I feel right at home and I only wish it could run on electricity. Great range, spacious interior, decent sound, fun to drive but not for showing off, and it all works great. All the other stuff I can live without, and I feel so many would think the same. 

It feels like smarter call for business to invest in lower end models like this too. You'd get a lot more average customers who can afford a lower price and will buy more of them than the smaller number of more well-off folk buying them. The adoption rate would be up, and demand for better ones overtime will add up for more profits.

post,15n1sl5,,My EQS sedan long term review,"So I leased an EQS 450+ sedan 4 months ago and wanted to give my thoughts in a brief long term use review. I'll break it down by category. 

Styling: Probably the biggest criticism you see about the EQS. Obviously this is subjective.  Personally I like it. I think it looks odd in pictures, but due to its size and stateliness looks better in person. It has a heft, stance, and weight that most sedans and other cars lack in an era where everything is a CUV. It is also fitting of an S class equivalent. That said, there's no denying it doesn't have the sex appeal or head turning nature of a Taycan, E-tron GT, or other 100k plus cars. 

Interior: I LOVE this cars interior. Great materials, good design, extremely comfortable seats. It has all the goodies like the massaging seats and what not. The UI is great and responsive. Voice controls work well. Built in navigation is excellent. I don't think I can ever buy a car without a HUD now. It is that awesome. This really separates this car from a Tesla, which feels cheap by comparison. On the downsides: wireless CarPlay is sometimes finicky or doesn't connect. The wireless charging spot is also finicky and sometimes doesn't charge. 

Handling and Ride quality: Another huge plus: It handles amazingly at low speed due to the rear wheel steering. You have to try it to believe it. It's a beast of a car but whips around low speed turns around the city like my old mazda2. At highway speeds it is super stable and comfortable. The air suspension is amazing. It is the quietest car at highway speeds I've ever seen. No road or wind noise. FWIW I've driven an EQE 350 SUV as well which has much more wind noise and body roll, unsurprisingly given the shape. On windy roads it is super planted and confident with no body roll, very poised. Of course it is an S class. It doesn't feel like a sports car and you don't feel the road like a model 3, but also much more comfortable. 

Performance: Another knock on this car is it's slow for the price. ",1691641130.0,2023-08-10 06:18:50,163,102,toado3,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/,True,0.96,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,15kl68b,,"Introducing... The ""EV Price Parity Scorecard"" (US Market)","So a little project I've been poking at the past few weeks here and there is something I'm calling the **""EV Price Parity Scorecard"".**

[**

It's an ongoing spreadsheet that shows the differences in MSRP between EVs and ICE vehicles in the same segment, from the same brand, configured to as close to feature parity as possible.

At the current stage of the EV transition, there are three categories of ""class parity"" among vehicles from the same brand:

* EVs that are directly based off of existing ICE models (or the other way around). This includes the Volvo XC40 Recharge and the BMW i4.
* EVs that are their own models / platforms compared to ICEs, but that share the same naming structure and market positioning. This includes the Mercedes EQS SUV versus the GLS, the Audi Q8 e-Tron versus the Q8, and the Chevrolet Blazer EV versus the Blazer ICE.
* EVs that have no direct equivalent but can be matched with an equivalent ICE in the brand based on the body style, available features, and exterior and / or interior dimensions. Think a Nissan Ariya versus a Rogue (X-Trail), a Volkswagen ID.4 versus a Tiguan (LWB), an Audi e-Tron GT versus an A7, and the like. Most of the vehicles on this spreadsheet are in this category.

For the spreadsheet, I stuck to models that were as close to performance parity as possible, so there may be some notable omissions. For example, there is no BMW iX in the US market that is below the ""50"" trim, but there is no pure ICE X5 ""50"" to compare it to. But both the X5 and iX have an ""M60"" trim, so that's the only one that shows up on the sheet. I'm not including PHEVs in this spreadsheet.

Also, I have not included any extra-cost paint colors, interior trim, or wheels in the comparisons. Everything is based on the ""zero-cost"" option. All prices on the list include the destination charges. The spreadsheet is based on MSRP and MSRP only, not factoring in potential tax credits, dealer markups, or dealer discounts.

Obviously no EV-only brands like T",1691415899.0,2023-08-07 15:44:59,185,119,lostinheadguy,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15kl68b/introducing_the_ev_price_parity_scorecard_us/,True,0.94,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15fryd9,,Hertz EV Manager Special - First EV Experience,"I just returned from the Boston/New England area where we rented from Hertz a 2023 Kia Niro EV for the week.  I had booked their EV Manager Special as it was at least $100 lower in cost than booking the Chevy Bolt category (and all other categories for EVs and gas vehicles were even more).  We were allowed to pick a Chevy Bolt or Kia Niro EV from a lineup down one row.  My wife picked the Niro because we own the hybrid 2019 version of that car (and it was orange).  Plus, she hated the size of the Bolt (and I hated its charge rate).  The EV was charged to 73% when we got it, so no charging was needed right away.  My wife noticed the acceleration and handling of the EV was much better than the hybrid.  She wasn't sure about the regen braking that takes place when you lift your foot off the accelerator for one pedal driving, but she got used to it quickly.  The tech in the lowest EV model of a Niro is like the high end version of the hybrid, so we enjoyed those perks as well (like auto closing trunk, wireless charging, extra storage space, etc.).  Hertz included a long cord and two adapters (one was a CCS to Tesla adapter or vice versa, but I know that would not work regardless).

We ended up the next day parking in a garage at Salem, MA with a slow charger.  There were 2 easily assessable spaces that put us close to the entrance, and the ChargePoint app worked just fine.  The cost of the parking was $1.25 per hr with the charging being free up to 4 hrs.  We ended up with 87% SOC at that 4 hr point and I just moved the car over to another spot.

The next day we went to Newport, Rhode Island and used a slow charger there at the university while we walked the cliff walk and visited some historical manors.  We were charged $1.25 per hr for a rate of 6kw per hr.  That evening, I had to use my first DC fast charger on the way back as we planned to go to Maine the next day.  It was a ChargePoint that was labeled 125kw shared between 2 units.

post,15f69xd,,"After a bunch of shopping around, I just leased a BMW i4 e35 to replace my Tesla as my new daily","I've been in the fortunate position to have a weekend fun car + daily 2 car garage for a while. For a daily Tesla Model 3 for 4 years until I sold it last summer for almost how much I paid for it initially, right before I moved to another country.

Now I'm back in the States and I need another daily again. No, despite what you hear the 718 GTS is a terrible daily driver, especially a manual one in this atrocious Pacific Northwest traffic. After 2 weeks my left calf is now visibly larger than my right one, thanks to the heavy clutch. And getting around 16 mpg when gas price is $6/gallon doesn't feel good either.

The following are the cars I considered and drove:

**Tesla Model 3**: Best cost/performance EV powertrain in the business. A Model 3 Performance is 15% cheaper than a Kia EV6 GT and 30% cheaper than a BMW i4 M50, while having longer range and the Tesla charger network. But I want something different this time around. I wanted something with a *premium* interior and good noise insulation, two things that I disliked the most about the Model 3. 

**Kia EV6**: Great packaging and good platform. Looks good from the outside, a ton of space inside, decent range and very good value. The interior material/build quality feels cheap. However the deal breaker was the seats. Something was protruding weirdly in the back against my lower spine and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what. Tried lumbar adjustment, different car, etc, didn't go away. Can't buy a car that I don't feel comfortable sitting in.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5**: Great car. Slightly better than the Kia EV6 in many ways and feels more premium. However I had the *exact* issue with the seats (probably same source). No go for me personally, but I highly recommend it.

**Genesis GV60**: Now this was a shockingly good car. I liked the polarizing exterior design and the interior was drop dead gorgeous, with details and materials that punch far above its segment.

Single car household as we both work from home and are childless. Our 2021 X5 lease was up and when we sat down and really thought it through moving into an EV was the obvious choice. We really don’t do long toad trips anymore which was always my only concern. Didn’t make sense to go ICE once I got over fear of potential range anxiety situations in the off chance we can’t fly for some reason.

Test drove the Model X, GV70, Q8 e-tron, and R1S as well, but the iX was just the best package overall to us and my personal clear favorite in driving feel. Clear runner up for us was the Q8. GV70 was pretty nice, but closest Genesis dealer is far from us and didn’t get the best impression of service from them during our time there. R1S was super cool in terms of all the utility stuff, but I would never take it off road and didn’t love how it felt around the edges on pavement. Model X just felt meh across the board but didn’t help we drove it second to last.

Went with a 2023 because the air suspension and 4-wheel steering are gone in the 2024 50i and they were must haves after driving a 2023 and 2024 back to back. The extra power in the M60 was complete overkill to us so didn’t make sense whatsoever to move up to that. Took some searching, but found our unicorn which was a Shadowline (we actually preferred over more expensive Sport trim), that wasn’t hit with any 2023 build option deletion issues and was fully loaded (minus laser lights), at a dealer about 150 miles away.

-Model X had great acceleration and interface, but felt very lacking in material quality and other luxury features.

post,14jlr7a,,Q8 e-tron initial observations,"I was finally able to trade in my Tesla model 3 (good riddance! ... JK ...  overall it was not the worst car, and my best EV choice at the time I purchased it) for the Q8 Etron, which I ordered in January 2023. Delivery last week. I had a very smooth experience with my Audi dealership in Ontario, which was a pleasant surprise. Bad dealership experience was my main reason to switch to Tesla three years ago. These are my observations after about 1000 kilometres in the past week (honeymoon phase):

Positive: 

1. This thing is built like a tank, fit and finish, and quality is far superior compared to Tesla (this applies to all Tesla models, not just model 3. model s and x are significantly more expensive and without a doubt have worse quality in every possible way).

2. better safety features such as proper Blindspot monitoring, and a good mix of buttons and knobs, combined with touchscreen infotainment system (looking at you Tesla). Proper windshield wiper control! (it's ridiculous that this needs to be mentioned)

3. Ride quality is superior to every other EV I tested (Tesla model Y, Tesla model X, Volvo XC 40 recharge, Hyundai ioniq 5, Kia EV 6, and BMW iX). Very quiet, minimum wind and road noise. 

4. The original etron, and the initial “reviews” on YouTube for q8 etron model have been critical of efficiency, however my initial observation over the past 1000 km has been positive, likely because I elected to go with the “smaller” 20 inch wheels, and I suspect the wheel size plays a significant role in others getting suboptimal results. So far I've been getting consistently above 480-500 km range on a full charge, sticking to 110km on highway (which beats the EPA range estimate). I plan to get 19 inch wheels for winter tires. 

5. more choice with Apple CarPlay and android auto instead of an arrogant approach that the car company can provide “the best infotainment experience” (American makers such as Tesla, Lucid, Rivian)

post,13w1myx,,"One Year, One Week old Tesla Model 3","1 year. 1 week. Owned Blastoise for 53 weeks and man… what an awesome experience. Took this car everywhere from Los Angeles (a couple of times), to Portland (countless times), to San Francisco, to Vancouver, BC, to Cascade mountains, to Ocean Shores, to Long Beach and daily driving, totaling 35,329 miles driven. 

Was skeptical about electric vehicles, especially battery degeneration but so far, it seems like the battery is still very healthy. 

How do I know it’s very healthy? With a small sample from today’s driving, drove 183 miles and the car consumed 38 kWh. With an efficiency of 207 Watt hour (Wh) per mile. Averaging 60 mph and outside temp about 70 F. 
Blastoise has a 75 kWh battery pack. 
Math breakdown: With an efficiency of 207 Wh/mi. 1 kWh = 4.831 miles. 75 kWh x 4.831 = 362 miles. On a good day, this car can still travel over 350 miles in one full charge. Now that’s amazing! 

In larger sample size. Blastoise traveled 35,329 miles, averaging  239 watt hour per mile and consumed a total of 8,430 kWh. After driving all four season in various weather conditions and driving conditions, in one full charge, Blastoise can go about 313 miles. 45 miles less then an EPA range of 358 miles. Approximately 87% battery life remain. But that number is arbitrary. I expect during warmer months the efficiency will be better and the battery degradation will improve. All in all, this 2022 Tesla Model 3 is absolutely amazing!

Let’s talk about money saved compared to gas. My previous car was a 2010 Honda Civic. 

In the past year, IF I drove the Civic 35,000 miles, it would have consumed 1,000 gallons of gasoline. I would have paid roughly $4,300 in gas. 
*(Civic mpg is about 35mpg, average gas price for the past year I’d say is ROUGHLY $4.30/gal)

Past year, I drove Blastoise about 35,329 miles consumed 8,430 kWh and it  would have costed $917 in electricity IF I charged at home the whole time but I didn’t. Did some super charging on road trips, so I estimated $1,100 in tot",1685479651.0,2023-05-30 22:47:31,21,22,Slight-Anteater-8390,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/13w1myx/one_year_one_week_old_tesla_model_3/,True,0.68,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,12bmumo,,Why would anyone get a Tesla model X?,"I have a really hard time understanding the X at its price point.

Full disclosure, my wife bought a 2023 model Y and I am waiting on a pre-March Rivian R1S.

My EV journey started last year. Preordered the Y for 58k. Ended up hearing about the Rivian and realizing there is no way model Y is a 58k car. After waiting for like 4 months, I sold my reservation for 2.5k because Y was then something like 65k. I preordered a R1S at the same time for like 78k because it looked like a value proposition.

Recently Tesla suddenly dropped its price. My wife bought the Y, at a price lower than the reservation price I had last year. After all incentives her pretax cost would be 43k.

Just found out I can still get tax credit for the rivian R1S bringing the pretax price to 71k.

So we are getting two cars for a total of 114k pretax.

Meanwhile a base model X was 120k before the price drop and 100k after. I literally cannot tell it apart from a model Y before my wife got the Y.

post,120phm9,,JuiceBox question,"This week I had my JuiceBox 48 installed to charge my Model Y. After the installation I tried it and it delivered 48A power to the car showing in the Tesla app. I then downloaded the EV JuiceNet app from iOS store and followed the steps to register and connect the device to Wi-Fi.

After I connected to Wi-Fi, I noticed the max power became 6A in the Tesla app. I opened EV JuiceNet app and saw the max power was 6A in ""Device Setting"". I updated the setting to 48A as well as my address in the app, but every time I hit ""save"" the app gave me an error message, so I was stuck with 6A for a few hours.

I then started looking for a solution and only to find people complaining about the new app causing a lot of problems, and possibly lock the max power to 6A. I was going to contact Enel X but somehow the app allowed me to save the setting, so the max power became 48A again. Ever since that I notice the app has some problems connecting to the server. If it connects then all my settings are showing in the app, but if it doesn't then settings are empty and the max power is 6A. However, it doesn't seem to affect the actual device. Even the EV JuiceNet app says the max is 6A, the charger can still charge at 48A according to the Tesla app.

Also the LED color on the device is always purple if I don't use it. I checked the manual purple means ""offline"". So does that mean my JuiceBox is not connected to Wi-Fi the whole time? I don't mind if it is offline as long as I can charge it at 48A because all the functions I need can be controlled in the Tesla app.

Here are few questions that I have:

a. Why do we need that EV JuiceNet app? If the car app can do everything, the EV JuiceNet app seems unnecessary

b. I understand the new app is a disaster, but if it doesn't work can we just use the device as a dumb charger and control all the settings in the car app?

c. Is there something I am missing here?

post,11cpy54,,What are the best EVs for towing cross country?,"As I learn more about towing in an EV I'm not seeing any obvious signs that one particular EV is better than another - and when we factor in charging I wonder if Teslas are currently the most practical EVs for towing long distance.  I'd like to pose a hypothetical scenario and hear your opinions on which car(s) would be best.  I'd like to limit the discussion mostly to EVs that are on the market and available TODAY.

- [Casita Freedom Trailer]( - 17ft, 2500 lbs
- Cross country east coast to west coast (~3,500 miles)

The vehicles that stand out to me are of course both Rivians, the F150L, and the Model Y and the Model X.  What other vehicles could potentially tow this trailer?

I've heard really good things about towing in all of these vehicles, people often say ""you wouldn't even know there's something behind you"".  What's interesting here is I've never heard anyone say towing in an EV truck **feels** better than towing in a Tesla.  So if all these vehicles can tow a 2500 lbs trailer comfortably, what are the factors we should compare?

Range - Which vehicle is going to give me the longest range?  From what I've seen, all of these vehicles will tow between 80-100 miles.  Again, I'm not seeing any advantage from the F150L or Rivians.  I can assume the Model X will have a bit more range than the Model Y.  While range matters, we can't just drive from full to empty, we need to stop at a charger wherever they happen to be placed.

Charging time - The (2020) Model Y has the smallest battery (75kWh), it'll charge the fastest.  That's a plus (kinda).  The Model X has a 100kWh battery.  The trucks are around 130kWh so charge time is ~30% more than the MX and ~75% more than the MY.  So both teslas come out ahead here.

Charging stations - It's a no brainer the teslas are going to win here - the supercharger network is super valuable, but with a CCS to Tesla adapter the MY and MX can charge at all the same charging stations as the F150L and R1T/R1S.

This will be a lengthy post regarding comparing the 2 cars (VW ID4, Tesla MYP) on mostly subjective topics, but I wanted to give some insights on what I like / dislike while staying honest with myself. 

Some things I want to get out first:  


* I have 1 infant to take with me and my SO
* I live in Europe, public charging infrastructure still sucks, see below
* I 'owned' (company car) the ID4 for 1 year (25k km)
* I own (bought with my own company now) the MYP for 1 month (5k km)
* I have a tech background (software architecture)
* I've been converted from an Apple hating standpoint to an Apple fanboy in the past
* I'm not a Tesla fanboy
* I hated Tesla's seamingly cheap build quality from older models that I've driven in (Mostly US built)
* I loved Elon's memery, today I couldn't even say a good word about him due to activities
* Previous cars I drove: Renault Kangoo, Audi A1, Audi A3, BMW X2, BMW 320, Mercedes CLA, Peugeot 308 SW

&#x200B;

Configuration of the cars:

* VW ID4: Pro Max edition - Which basically meant that I had all options ticked where possible. Total car budget came to 63K Euro. Had the original black color, brown interior, black sport seats, standard rims, all other packages included
* Tesla Model Y Performance: Black exterior, black seats, towing package, basic Autopilot. Total car budget came to 67K Euro.

Other cars I was considering to replace the ID4, but didn't pick in the end (budget max was 85k Euro, had to be fiscally optimal →  EV / PHEV required):

* Audi Q4 / VW ID4 / Skoda Enyaq: Such good cars, but I wanted something different now that I could pick whatever I wanted (within budget).
* VW Tiguan (PHEV): Boring.
* Hyundai Ioniq 5 (EV): Software seemed too cluttered. The exterior design was too outspoken for me. Feature wise this was a very complete car.
* Kia EV6 (EV): I freacking loved this car, but waiting 2 years for it wasn't going to happen. Software also seemed too cluttered.

Weird stuff like this used to happen with my Model X, but I dumped it because of the quirks like that.  

Has this ever happened to you?  How to prevent it?  What to do about it?

post,10ei7ll,,Looking for a 3-row EV? Don't have $100K to spend? Consider the Chrysler Pacifica PHEV,"My family needed a 3 row vehicle and we wanted an EV, but we couldn't afford a Model X or an R1S. Enter the only PHEV minivan in the US market: the Chrysler Pacifica. MSRP of $59,500(ish) as spec'd in ""Limited"" trim with optional packages.

We've owned it for just over a month now and we love it. Gets 30+ miles of EV range and has enough power for freeway driving without switching to the ICE. Over a span of two weeks, we did 400 miles of normal daily driving, 390 on EV and 10 in hybrid mode. I'd say that's pretty much an EV.

Tech is pretty good overall, but the focus is clearly on convenience as opposed to self-driving. The 2018 Honda Accord we traded in had much better lane keeping, but the adaptive cruise control on the Pacifica is comparable. Wireless android auto/carplay is a great feature, as is being able to connect 2 phones at once. It can also park itself either parallel or perpendicular, which is occasionally convenient given its size.

As you'd expect from a minivan, it's got a huge amount of cargo space and seating for 7. The stowable 3rd row seats are very nice, as I was able to easily haul 40 folding chairs and still have seating for 4 adults. It also does that thing where you can automatically open the rear hatch and sliding doors by kicking your foot under the vehicle, which I thought would just be a novelty but I've used a surprising amount.

Honestly, the last minivan I drove was a '97 Nissan Quest, and the advances in design since then are great. Each of the 2nd row seats has its own screen with Amazon Fire TV.  We don't use it enough to pay for the service ($20/month), but we will for long road trips, and in the meantime we can use the HDMI ports.

My main concern in buying it was long term reliability. The previous model run (2018-2020, I think) had a ton of problems. I'm hoping the 2021- onward models fare better, but we just had to risk it given the dearth of other options in our price range.

&#x200B;

[Vinfast VF 8 exterior](

&#x200B;

[Vinfast VF 8 interior](

Since I heard that there is a Vinfast store in Montreal, I decided to drive all the way from Boston to Montreal QC just to check out the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 9. Obviously, Vinfast has seen a lot of controversy both on YouTube as well as Reddit with many accusing it of vapourware and many thinking that it is DOA (dead on arrival), but the Vinfast showroom has seen a lot of consumer interest not only amongst Vietnamese people, but I have also met one Laotian family, one Cambodian family, as well as many people from different races and ethnicites. Since the full tour and review on YouTube would talk about the specs, I am only going to examine the pros and cons of this car to see if Vinfast even has a chance in the US market given the fact that Tesla dropped the price of the Model Y to about 53k for the Long Range Edition.

**Positive aspects of Vinfast:**

* The Vinfast VF 8 Plus does have a lot of safety features such as traffic jam assist, auto parking, and smart summon (debatable if these safety features really work or they are just vapourware) as well as a big 15.6 inch infotainment system with a browser, voice recognition, navigation, as well as OTA updates. The fully equipped VF 8 plus even comes with a power liftgate (VF 8 Eco however has a manual liftgate), a panoramic sunroof, vegan leather, power seats, an electronic gear shifter/parking brake, as well as a frunk, just like the Tesla Model Y. It even has a heads up display and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, something which Tesla doesn't have on their cars, albeit CP/AA doesn't work on the Pre-production models.
* Both have surprisingly decent styling. Even though the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 6 would look more like a traditional car like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Mazda CX-50, Nissan Rogue, Mercedes Benz GLC, BMW X3, etc, especially with the traditional door handles, the Vinfast VF 9 and VF 7 have a more radic",1673832549.0,2023-01-16 02:29:09,13,11,MussleGeeYem,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/10d1aak/i_drove_all_the_way_from_boston_to_montreal_just/,True,0.69,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,10c4mdt,,Who really takes the hit from Tesla price cuts,"This post is an analysis for which auto manufacturers will be hit the hardest by the Tesla price cut.

First of all, the model S/X price cut is mostly irrelevant to new buyers. Those who can pay $100k+ for a car don’t really care about $10k. But those who wants to sell their used S/X won’t be too happy because their selling price got cut a bit.

Secondly, I suppose we can all agree is that the most impact will be felt on the owners and buyers of Tesla model 3/Y. Then the million dollar question is: who buys model 3/Y? It’s most likely the medium to high income individuals and families. 

So let’s see what are the popular cars at the price range of ~$30k for sedan, ~$40k for SUV:

For sedans: Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Volvo V60, Hyundai Sonata… (including any popular EVs in the price range such as Bolt)

For SUVs: Hyundai Tuscan, RAV4, ID4, Mache E … 

Before the price cut, the people who wants Tesla (I would say a lot of people do) cannot afford Tesla. Now with the price cut, suddenly they can just get a brand new EV with slick design and phenomenal software for $36k (sedan) or ~$50k (SUV)! They would seriously think about not buying the ICE cars or other legacy brand EVs and jump on the Tesla bandwagon. Plus they know they will save big on gas!

Therefore the conclusion is clear: the price cut would affect the sales of other volume production mid-tier cars, especially the legacy car companies (think Toyota, Hyundai, Honda …) the most because their customers are going to be seriously attracted to Tesla model 3/Ys. That would put a dent on their sales of their mid-tier sedan/SUV and bottom line. They will eventually have to cut prices to compete.

Of course the owners who wants to sell will be pretty unhappy.. but that’s another topic..

Note: this is about which companies are going to be hit the HARDEST.",1673740305.0,2023-01-15 00:51:45,61,458,No_Low_2541,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/10c4mdt/who_really_takes_the_hit_from_tesla_price_cuts/,True,0.62,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,key7ub,,"Proposed Constitutional Challenge for excess EV re-registration fees: ie., in AL, AR, GA, IN, IL, MO, OH, WV, WY, etc.,.","**BACKGROUND**

Texas is considering implementing an EV re-registration fee to replace the revenue lost from gasoline taxes for roads and bridges.  The Texas SB-604 report has a nice break-down of how other states have dealt with the issue on page 35, and is [available here]( Spoiler alert, based on the Texas analysis, the fee replacement should be approximately **$100** a year for EVs and **$80** for hybrids.

Of course, I'd heard about the $200 EV re-registration fees popping up here and there, and I always just thought, ""man, someone really ought to lobby against that..."" and yet, here we are.  There's a bunch of states that now have $150, $200 or more re-registration fees for EVs.

**LEGAL STANDARD**

When I was hearing about these fees in the abstract in other states where I don't live, I was regarding this as what is known as a [""political question""]( which essentially means, it's up to the legislative process, and courts shouldn't be involved because I was thinking of it as a [nonjusticiable issue](

Basically, EV owners aren't a [protected class]( It's a voluntary choice to own an EV -- so rational basis scrutiny applies to the legal examination of laws that disproportionately impact EV owners.  It is exceedingly difficult to get a law struck down on the basis that it violates rational basis scrutiny.

But now that Texas is considering adopting a fee, and some yokel jokel in the Texas panhandle is following the no-doubt AEI or Koch-brothers-inspired $200 re-registration fee template -- I have come to the realization that *you actually can make an equal protection challenge to these fees that is likely to overcome even rational basis scrutiny*.

But... **who is to bring this legal challenge, and who is to coordinate it?  Is this a job for Plug-in America?  I'm not sure.**

Anyway, the argument goes like this:

**ARGUMENT**

The gasoline tax is necessarily proportional to both miles driven, and damage to roads.

post,irw1hj,,"I drove the Porsche Taycan 4S for an hour, and here are my thoughts on the strengths and weakness of it against all the Tesla I've driven.","Due to some luck I had a [Porsche Taycan 4S]( all to myself for about an hour. As a big fan of both Tesla and Porsche, I've driven many of the modern Porsches and I've driven almost all of the Tesla models (including all Performance Model S/3/X except the OG Roadster and the Model Y. I currently DD an AWD Model 3 with acceleration boost. Here are some of my thoughts on many of the aspects of the Taycan from the perspective of a long time Tesla driver.

**Exterior design**: It's all subjective, but I think it's one of the two best looking 4 door sedan on the planet right now, EV or otherwise. Small details like the [headlights]( just really sets it apart from the competition.

**Powertrain**: The 4S is the ""slowest"" Taycan model at *only* 3.8s 0-60. But in typical Porsche fashion it's probably a little quicker than that. It launches slightly harder than my Model 3 (3.9s 0-60 according to Tesla) but definitely won't blow away anyone who's been driving any of the Performance Tesla models. One thing I both liked and disliked was the two-gear transmission. On one hand it pulls hard at speed well north of 70mph (far quicker than my Model 3 at that speed) but despite how amazing PDK is in their ICE cars, that one shift just feels *jarring* in the context of an EV. It's barely noticeable but once you notice it, it's hard to ignore. 

Additionally, it doesn't regen nearly as hard as Tesla does when you lift foot off the throttle, that may be jarring for some EV owners but since I often drive ICE sports cars on weekends it didn't bother me. However I prefer Tesla's implementation as far as an EV experience goes.

**Handling/Chassis/Steering**: The unit I drove had PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) and All Wheel Steering, but did not have the physics defying electromechanical anti-roll bar system. But even then it's **by far** the best handling and best steering EV I've driven by a mile. It weights about 600lbs heavier than my Model 3 yet has less body roll, far bett",1599993554.0,2020-09-13 12:39:14,236,107,cookingboy,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/irw1hj/i_drove_the_porsche_taycan_4s_for_an_hour_and/,True,0.94,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,ihiv9g,,Making a tesla roadster with today's technology,"Im not talking about the upcoming, bells and whistles roadster with rocket boosters and such.

The original roadster was based on a lotus, had a 53 kwh battery and had an EPA rating of 250 miles, thought this was with the 2 cycle test, not the 5 cycle test the EPA uses now, which is harder. tested today, its more likely the Roadster had a 5 cycle EPA test range of 200 miles.

According to wikipedia, the battery PACK density was rated at 117wh/kg (cell density would be much higher)

does anyone know what the pack density  of teslas currently are? 

I've heard rumours of 160wh/kg. which would give a roadster of today, with a 53kwh battery pack a 260 mile plus EPA rating roughly speaking.

that would give the roadster a 337kg battery, eeking out a bit more range due to weight savings or even space with a slightly smaller battery pack

I wish this car could be made now. it would be in the range of BMW Z4, Porshe Boxter,

Just a question if anyone has better knowledge. We're looking at a backup commercial power solution. Obvious choice would have been diesel generators, but no one likes that!

Second choice, batteries (Tesla or equivalent).

Alternative is using our EV van as a v2g.

post,ftu1oy,,Manifesto (in short some important stuff on the market),"Suggestion:
Dear manufacturers, car owners, carmakers and modders. In this post, I would like to give you an idea, a possible direction of making electric cars more affordable and better.
1* Please for the love of my parents unify the chargers. It's impossible to find a charger to fit your car. You have to carry 10kg of adapters for your car to drive freely. Please standardize the charging points and make them accessible licence free online for us to modify them to make them better (lighter etc.)
2* Better battery cells. Please don't pretend it's the early 2000. Use the latest tech battery cells. I recommend using LiFePo4. They are not that different to popular LiPo but unlike them, they are not flammable, and easier to use. They are nearly 3 times lighter than popular cells. The best representation of that is that Tesla 3 with these batteries would be 350kg lighter. Making it a 1t car.
3* Try using reusable energy sources to better the range. I installed solar panels on my friend's charging station to make it more affordable. It would be great if you installed solar panels on the car roof, boot or even front. They are affordable and bendable. They are already being used on campers and military vehicles so they are easy to buy. In my upcoming project, I`m using turbofan to charge my batteries on motorways (highways). That way the power comes from solar panels on the roof, fans being grill already cooling batteries and regeneration braking. And from battery and motor heat (want to know more ask me in the comments).
4* Make batteries easy to change for example so you can swap mustangs battery with chevy volt. Now when you break a battery you have to order a specific one and wait about a month for the shipment. That would make eco-driving more user friendly and would make companies compete in their cell qualities.
5* Use wheel hub type motors. They let the wheels rotate each in a different direction (turning while standing in place), make suspension less stressed, and ",1585859880.0,2020-04-02 22:38:00,7,13,Automatitiongeek,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ftu1oy/manifesto_in_short_some_important_stuff_on_the/,True,0.89,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,f8x4xt,,"How many ""EV Startups"" are vaporware?","I say this in reference to the growing amount of ""manufactures"" that have announced their plans to build and release a model, sometimes with nay a clay model to show; let alone a working prototype. Companies like Rivian and Bollinger were at least able to provide a vehicle to show, more than 12-24 months from release. If that's a reasonable timetable, why don't other startups show off even a single concept prototype and often just have a render?

Don't take this as FUD, I would love nothing more than to see every new startup produce new models for the market, I just wonder how many are clever marketing and a flashy website vs actual manufacturing capacity. 

a few that come up from my research:


 - 2021 Lordstown Endurance

 - No official images beyond a drawing/render on their website.

>I believe this one to be a bit more likely. They say they're showing off the truck at Detroit. Still a lot of unknowns.

 - Faraday Future FF91
 - 
 - First unveiled in 2017. Pre-production model created in 2018.
 - Working vehicle has been demonstrated at events.
 - Filed for bankruptcy this past October.

>Loved the design, but kinda given up on this one becoming a reality.

 - Atlis XT

 - $1M received from crowdfunding campaign. 
 - No working prototype publicly seen. only CG renders on company website.
 - Website claims 15-minute full charge with new battery tech, decreasing to 5 minutes in the future.
 - V2G, Liquid-cooled battery, Solar connectivity. They claim to have their own skateboard Chassis platform they want to license out.
 - Supposedly, there was an event at their HQ this past Friday but no news articles to speak of.

post,j5y0r1,,I kept track of every dollar I spent on my Tesla Model 3. Here's the breakdown after 2 years of ownership.,"Hey guys,

I bought my Tesla Model 3 two years ago in Toronto. Since then, I’ve kept track of every dollar I’ve spent on it. Here’s what I’ve spent on the car after 50,000km of driving. I hope this can help anyone who might be on the fence or wondering about how much it costs to drive a Model 3 in Canada.

[I also made a video if that makes it easier to follow.]( (no ads, but there's some cool footage of the car)

## Cost of the Car

I picked up my car on June 5th, 2018. At that time, there wasn’t much flexibility when it came to options. I could only choose the long-range rear wheel drive option.

Here’s the breakdown of the cost.

Base price of the car was $45,600.00

Long range battery upgrade was $11,900.00

Premium upgrade was $6,600.00

In terms of options, I went with the Midnight Silver Metallic colour, which cost me $1300 and I purchased Tesla’s enhanced autopilot package for $6600, which included things like summon, lane changes, and lane keeping.

After taxes, the car cost me $83,169.35.

Because I got my car before the provincial election in Ontario, I was able to qualify for the EV rebate, which at the time was $14000 in Ontario. I received that about 6 months after purchasing my car. That brought the total cost of the car down to $69,169.35.

Insurance is kind of high where I live. I used to pay $192/month for the first couple years and a few months ago, my premium went up to $265/month because of a speeding ticket and more claims in my area. Overall, I’ve spent $5,668.00 on insurance so far.

## Charging Costs

Over the past two years, I’ve driven my car almost 50,000km. Most of the mileage comes from my daily commute to work, but I also took quite a bit of road trips.

Over the past two years, I’ve taken 3 trips to NYC from Toronto, 1 to upstate New York, 1 to Montreal, and 1 trip to Saskatoon. In total, I’ve covered about 15000 kilometres on the supercharger network.

post,j1aglj,,Considering selling my E-Golf 2018 to avoid future value dump,"Hi!

So I currently own an E-Golf 2018 rated @ 300 km range (more like 220 IRL lol).

I am a huge EV enthusiast and love my E-Golf but lately I've been getting some cold feet to owning it.

The way I see it, the next five years will mark a huge increase in EV technology in terms of cost, range, battery etc, and I consider the e-golf to be a kind of ""early protoype"". My reasoning is that the range is pretty moderate, its actually built on a ICE powertrain, shitty software, no autopilot etc.

So I'm afraid that the E-golf will have a pretty huge value dump the next few years.. Especially after Tesla talked about a 25k EV. Of course, I'm fully aware that cars are a shitty investment in general and will eventually loose most of its value, but I just feel we are seeing a new trend with exponential increase in EV's tech.

&#x200B;

Whats your thoughts on the subject? Would it be stupid to actually sell the car now and wait a few years (with a cheap ICE alternative MAYBE) for the ""next generation"" or is that doomed to fail?

However, they didn't accept it (either because I don't have enough karma or because it's too critical for them). If someone with more karma would like to post it there, it'd be fine with me.

&#x200B;

I) About me (not really relevant)

I ordered a Model Y a few months ago and expect delivery in about 1,5 years because GF4 has to be built first. I was aware of minor quality problems as well as as somewhat noisy and rather cheapish interior. But now I want an EV which should be sufficiently spacious for a family of 4 and a dog, so it’s got to be a SUV or hatchback. And despite these problems I’d prefer a Tesla, mostly due to its advantages in efficiency, range and (hopefully eventually coming) autopilot functionality. I’m not a Tesla “fanboy” or a “car guy” who will ever “love” his car. Neither do I own stock in Tesla or think it’s a great company or Elon Musk is a superhero, as some seem to. I just want a good/cool car and expect it do it’s job due to its specifications. 

So far, I’ve driven mostly French and German cars in the last 30 years but never really spent a lot of money on them (20-40K, sometimes used cars) and never worried about their quality or aspects such as paint and not parking them outside or hand-washing them. And there never was a need to worry. But, for a Tesla, I’d be willing to pay 60K and accept a few issues, especially since I’ve had the impression that customer service would fix these problems and was customer oriented.

II) The problem

However, from what I’m reading in Tesla forums there are two major problems:

\- extremely **poor quality** and faulty cars delivered to customers (problems with seat belts, seats, brakes, paint, MCU and God knows what else, you’ve probably read this, too. E.g. [

Up to a certain point, one could possibly accept this if it wouldn’t be combined with

post,ghviv2,,No frills Tesla?,"I rented a Model 3 Performance and Model X earlier this year and I both were excellent while driving. It was the secondary features and attributes that annoyed me. 

1. The very large windshields and glass roof was neat but if I had the choice I wouldn't want that. During certain times of the day the sun was very bright with not a lot of options to shade it. Plus the thought of having to replace it if it cracks from a rock chip. 
2. The powered doors on the X didn't work correctly on several occasions. The automatic rear lift gate closed on it's own while putting stuff in the trunk (probably from the fob in my pocket) but I would much rather just open a mechanical door. 
3. Navigating the interior controls were unnecessarily complicated. It wasn't hard but I would rather just turn a knob for a cold/warm air and turn another for the fan speed.
4. The powered middle seats in the X was convenient but it seemed like just something else that could break. 
5. I enjoyed adaptive cruise control and tried autopilot and it worked for the most part but it was annoying have to put pressure on the wheel. It took a conscious effort to just put a slight amount of pressure so that I wouldn't disengage autopilot and swerve it. 

I would really love a no frills Tesla. Something basic that has the range and power of a Tesla without all the extra stuff. Does anyone else have the same desire? Like Toyota/Lexus I'd prefer Toyota

post,gajdf6,,Electric Boats,"This article was from about 4 years ago but has there been any movement in the boating scene with EV conversions?

I live at a lake and recently sold a ski boat due to the endless maintenance and nightmare it was. Overall took a $600 loss on the boat after a few months. 

I can’t help but realize the incredible potential for EV conversions on boats. Imagine someone taking the guts of a Model 3 and sticking it into a boat? Screen, wheel, drive motor, battery modules, and all. (Except autopilot sensors of course)

Huge potential in the market considering what a money pit older boats become. I’d love seeing the shell of a ski boat become one. Those are direct drive boats (meaning inboard motor and no outboard equipment). An old mastercraft or other ski branded boat I’d imagine would set up to be a rather simple conversion given the nature of how the engine is mounted downward in the boat directly moving the propellor. With the proper shell and weight capacity the modules could even act as ballast bags creating a larger wake for surfers and wakeboarders. 

I wish I had the resources to do something like this but I was curious if anyone had seen something like this.",1588199593.0,2020-04-30 00:33:13,12,21,irllydontknow_,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/gajdf6/electric_boats/,True,0.78,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ewwuqq,,Experiencing AutoPilot in third person,"Today in rush hour traffic I spent about 10 highway miles behind a tesla model 3, which was quite obviously on autopilot because it stayed perfectly in the center of the lane. However, the best part was that the car not once hit the brakes, and probably stayed within 3-5mph of the same speed regardless of the stop and go going on around us. As a result, I only had to hit the brakes a few times in those 10 miles. It was actually pretty amazing to see how autopilot performs from a third person perspective. Imagine if every single car on the highway was driving like that. No car would do stop-and-go, and traffic would flow much smoother and faster. This is going to be the biggest, yet most subtle impact tesla has on the car/transportation industry.",1580512565.0,2020-02-01 00:16:05,82,47,JoddTones,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ewwuqq/experiencing_autopilot_in_third_person/,True,0.93,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ev9qpd,,The 2021 RAV4 PHEV may have just won me over from my Tesla Model Y Pre-Order,"My wife and I have been planning on getting a Model Y since it was announced, which would be my daily driver. I have been driving a 2015 RAV4 gas model, so I wanted to keep having a CUV. I am also a sucker for good tech. I think Autopilot is just one of the neatest features available, and that alone has us willing to pay a premium for the Tesla branding.

Well, my wife likes my 2015 RAV4, so we just got her a 2020 RAV4 Hybrid. Wow, as a RAV4 daily driver, the improvements even in the lowest trim are immense even compared to my 2015 model.

##Self Driving

For those who don't know, all 2020 base trims of every model of Toyota come with a rudimentary self-driving suite:

* Radar Adaptive Cruise Control as low as 19 MPH, and can go all the way to 0 with a lead car.
* Auto Lane Centering
* Lead Car Follow (for when it loses visibility of lane lines through intersections, etc)

Having test-driven a Model 3, and having driven my wife's new RAV4, I can genuinely say that Toyota's solution is competent on the highway. It doesn't *really* offer a hands-free experience (it'll ask you to hold the steering wheel every 10 seconds), but if you rest your hand on the wheel, it'll drive itself on highways.

##Range

The 2021 PHEV is expected to have an EV range of 39 miles. For my personal daily commutes, that's more than enough to get me to work and back without needing a drop of gas. The only time I will tap into the fuel tank would be when we take trips. The only question that's currently unanswered is what the fuel tank size will be. 

The Prius vs Prius Prime have the same tank size and the same hybrid-mode fuel economy, so I expect that the 2021 RAV4 Prime would continue to have 38 highway MPG and a 14.5g tank. However, the tank size is a point of contention in RAV4 forums, because [Toyota seems to report ""Empty"" at 3 gallons remaining and the pump stops at 13.75. So, the functional tank size is only 10.75 gallons](

So, on the highway one could expect 410 miles of Hybrid Rang",1580237784.0,2020-01-28 19:56:24,45,114,MrMusAddict,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ev9qpd/the_2021_rav4_phev_may_have_just_won_me_over_from/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,hrubz8,,"Planning to buy a new car in 2021, which EV do you recommend and why?","Hi everyone,

I am currently driving a 2003 ICE sedan that has served me quite well over the years. However, I am in the market for a new car soon and would love it to be an EV. TBH, I am strongly considering the Tesla Model 3 for several reasons, but want to make sure I seriously consider alternatives before pulling the trigger.

Main reasons I like the Tesla Model 3:

• Innovation and Technology (OTA updates, FSD/AP)

• Sleek design

• Long range and supercharger network

What EVs do you like and highly recommend? I have looked at the i3 and Bolt, but they seem fairly comparable in cost with the Model 3, so I'd rather pay a little more and go with the Model 3. Am I missing something?

I live in a larger metropolitan area and drive about 30 miles round trip to work, but if I am working on another gig, that can go up to 100 miles round-trip. Sometimes, I go on road trips that would be about 180 miles one way. This is where long range and supercharging would come in handy. I currently live in an apartment and plan to find one that offers EV charging as an amenity.

Anyways, I'd love to hear your recommendations and thoughts. Thanks in advance!",1594841599.0,2020-07-15 21:33:19,13,41,wizardforce,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/hrubz8/planning_to_buy_a_new_car_in_2021_which_ev_do_you/,True,0.78,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,hxbsd7,,Tesla will produce battery cells in Brandenburg,"According to [German reports]( Tesla and the Brandenburg state government (via minister of the economy Jörg Steinbach SPD) confirmed that Teslas factory in Grünheide will be producing battery cells and packs.

[Excerpt from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung - FAZ](

In the building application that the company submitted to the Brandenburg State Environmental Agency at the beginning of January, the factory was still an integral part of the factory - hardly surprising for a manufacturer of electric cars.  The surprise was all the greater when Tesla submitted a new application in early July.  In it, the car manufacturer explicitly mentions the ""elimination of plant A007 Battery Pack"" as one of the most important changes.  Now, just a short time later, the company is making another U-turn: ""There will be a local cell production that meets the needs of the Berlin factory,"" Musk said in the company's online conference on the latest quarterly figures.  This would theoretically render the recently submitted application invalid.



Upon request, the company confirms that there will indeed be battery production on the site after all.  How this could be embedded in the planning is currently being examined.  An important role in this is likely to be played by the battery cell billion offered by Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier (CDU).  The first consortium that is to receive state subsidies for the establishment of battery cell production in Germany has been known for some time.  This includes the French manufacturer PSA with its German subsidiary Opel.  The second consortium is to be announced shortly.



That Tesla was trying to get money is an open secret.  Regarding the outcome of the talks, Altmaier recently said in a conversation with the F.A.Z.: ""Tesla will get money if it meets our conditions.  This means: Germany must not be used only as an extended workbench, research and development must also take place here"".  This is currently under review.  ""If so, which I",1595631134.0,2020-07-25 00:52:14,28,13,Bojarow,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/hxbsd7/tesla_will_produce_battery_cells_in_brandenburg/,True,0.85,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

You offered to buy Twitter for 54.20. Its pretty clear where your mind was at when you made that offer. I still thank you for the Model S you sold me and so many others for $69,420 on 4/20.

As someone that really wants SpaceX to succeed. Please please cut down on the frequency of the pot use a bit, if not for yourself then for your aspirations to play a role in making Humanity an interplanetary species. 

The more you use, the more impossible promises you make regarding Teslas self driving capabilities without needing LIDAR and USS as backups, and the more reckless and poorly thought out decisions you make with twitter. Its going to start influencing SpaceX at somepoint, and thats not good for anyone. If you need something, switch to Psilocybin. Jobs swore by the stuff. Helped him immensely in finding a way to actually deliver on his vision.

Talk to Bill Maher for an hour, do his podcast, do it sober, or on psilocybin (not THC). He will explain to you the importance of detoxing off of pot every so often, and his personal experiences doing so vs. not doing so.

As I see it he sold Tesla stock to the amount of $25Bn and borrowed the rest.  

He then moved his personal borrowings onto the company books after purchase.

As a result, the $13Bn of debt he actually created, in addition to wiping out the $6Bn of cash reserves the company had before he bought it.

I am no genius but i have to start wondering about the regulation of the purchase and the state of mind of the buyer and anyone involved in the purchase.

This is all prior to considering the actions since purchase which to me only spell the end for twitter.

So how much advertising spending do you think Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos promised Musk in exchange for full DMs of everyone one of their employees? 

More worrying is what he promised Mohammed bin Salman in exchange for Saudi Arabia’s $6 billion dollar investment into Musk’s Twitter buy. Salma al-Shehab, a Leeds University student, was recently sentenced to 34 years in jail by Saudi Arabia merely because she was following and retweeting accounts on Twitter that were critical of the Saudi government. You would think a “defender of free speech” as Musk claims to be would have atleast drawn attention to this injustice. Was silence regarding this part of what he agreed to in exchange for the $6 billion dollars?

What do you think Putin offered him in exchange for criticizing Ukraine and sucking western attention away from the conflict there. What do you think he offered for access to twitter DMs and account data. Access to critical materials for batteries? Money?

Or lets talk about Iran. Khomeini is currently overseeing squads of thugs raping female protestors and publicly hanging the rest. Videos of these atrocaties are all over reddit, and they used to be all over my twitter notifications as well. But these days tweets about these atrocities seem to be getting max deboosted while Musk sucks all the oxygen in the away West from what is occurring in Iran, China and Ukraine. Its no coincidence that Musk hasn’t said a peep about Iran raping torturing and suffocating people as young as 12 for protesting murders of women merely for having some hair visible.

post,ubywst,,Why Elon may be on a $44bil probation,"The thing about actual town squares is that they’re literally there for centuries.  Virtual town squares can move at the whim of a thought.

Twitter itself has no real value beyond its user base.  Its technology is mostly based on existing protocols and frameworks.  The only reason a better replacement hasn’t come along and been successful is because this vast user base had no reason to move - until, potentially, now.

People talk about how Musk is too powerful, but early Monday AM he actually gave an immense chunk of power back - if everyone slid off the platform to a Shiney new thing, complete with an “import” button to invite all their existing Twitter followers to be their Shiney followers, well, Mr Musk would be about $44 billion poorer.

So my dad is an avid sci-fi fan and he fell in love (in a straight boomer way) with Elon Musk's work because of the SpaceX rockets that land on their tails as they did in all the books he read growing up. My dad finally declared the book he's been writing ""finished"" after years of writing, revising, and tinkering. I've read a few chapters, which I liked, but I'm not able to give detailed feedback since I'm not well-read in sci-fi.

After my dad got laid off from his engineering job during the recession he sort of fell into a depression and put everything into this book. He keeps saying that he thinks Elon Musk would really like it, and I want to help him reach his dream of getting Mr. Musk to read it as a Christmas present for him.

post,18b05xu,,New Cybertruck EPA & CARB Certifications Spotted,"Within the last 24 hours several new Cybertruck documents have appeared on the EPA's website:

[Application for Cybertruck Beast](

[Application for Cybertruck AWD](

[Certificate Summary Information for Cybertruck Beast](

[Certificate Summary Information for Cybertruck AWD](

Usually the applications contain test results for the EPA's highway & city range cycles, though these initial submissions only contain dummy data and as such the official EPA rated range is not yet known, however some interesting details can still be gleaned:

* Both trucks feature a nominal 816 V and 150 Ah pack making for a pack size of about 122.4 kWh, which is in line with current speculation of 123 kWh
* The Beast variant features two rear permanent magnet motors making 212 kW (284 hp) each while the front permanent magnet motor makes 206 kW (276 hp)
* The AWD variant has an AC induction motor in front and permanent magnet motor in rear rated at 226 kW (303 hp) and 222 kW (297 hp)
* Curb weights are 6669 lbs (AWD) and 6898 lbs (Beast)

As part of the certification process Tesla is required to submit settings for dynamometer calibration by performing a Coastdown test in accordance with [standardized test procedures](  From these settings one can determine the Vehicle Road-Load Force experienced at various speeds, letting you plot an efficiency curve that can be directly compared to other vehicles using their EPA submissions.  Here are these curves for the Cybertruck against some existing EV trucks:

[Cybertruck Wh/mi Consumption](

[Cybertruck Relative Consumption](

The Cybertruck falls short of Rivian's efficiency at higher speeds but manages to handily beat the other EV truck competitors.  A few reference points:

Vehicle | 30 mph | 50 mph | 70 mph
---|---|----|----
Rivian R1T Performance Dual Max (21"") | 151 Wh/mi | 233 Wh/mi | 351 Wh/mi

post,1864wq2,,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside. Overall just a nicer,",1701201003.0,2023-11-28 20:50:03,318,224,syslog2000,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1864wq2/my_thoughts_on_upgrading_from_a_2022_model_3/,True,0.89,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,17osjlf,,Pics of Stealth Grey next to Midnight Silver,"I thought this might be useful for those that want a better idea as to what Stealth Grey looks like in person. I called my local dealer to see if they had any in stock and the guy on the phone told me to hurry over because they had one next to a grey Model 3. 

Some things I noticed: I see why they call it Stealth, because the color changes pretty drastically depending on the light and angle. Walking up to it I thought the guy was mistaken and that he was showing me a black Model X. Up close, it looks like a darker version of the existing Model 3 grey. 

I’m purchasing a Model S Plaid as they are letting me transfer over my unlimited supercharging (2018 Model S 75D) and I was torn between Black and Stealth Grey. After seeing it in person I opted for Stealth Grey! Delivery is Nov/Dec.

P.S. any tips on the best ways to sell used Model S’s would be appreciated.

post,17j4fud,,evtable.com - A no-nonsense database of all EVs available + top recommendations for your parents and friends,"Like many of you I'm the ""EV guy"" for family, friends, parents, friends of friends, etc.  A few years ago this was easy because Tesla was the only option.  Now I can't even keep up with all of the different EVs being announced.  I looked for some simple resources to keep myself up to date and that I could send to people in the market.  Most of what I found was crappy listicles and uncritical unhelpful reviews.

So I made [**evtable.com**]( where you can see:

* [All EVs (and PHEVs) available]( including key stats like range, price, size, MPGe, gas savings, etc.
* [Top recommended EVs]( for different types of buyers (obviously Tesla Model Y as the general recommendation)
* [Latest EV news]( curated toward the substantive things like new cars being announced.

If you find [evtable.com]( helpful:

* Think of the 1-2 people you know who are in the market for a new electric vehicle, and send them the site
* Subscribe to the email newsletter so you hear about major site and car updates (literally I've sent 1 of these in 3 months though, so trying to keep it to the good stuff)
* Leave a comment here with your suggestions for things I can add to the site to make it more helpful for the community

&#x200B;

Edit: Looks like my comment replies are getting auto-removed, but thanks for all the great suggestions below!  I'll definitely add in AWD and fast-charging info to the All page and the Quiz.  /u/homertool asked about selecting cars.  Once you select cars on the table, you can filter down to just those cars and share the data elsewhere.  For example you can copy the URL to a friend, or you can copy to reddit and it gives you the proper markdown like this:

post,1729a4h,,The cost of charging a Tesla,"As we all know, charging an electric vehicle is much cheaper than filling a gas vehicle. Especially Gas prices are creeping up again. Oil prices are up 30% since early July. But how much does it cost to charge an EV (I am only analyzing Tesla here)? In fact, it all depends on where you charge. If you choose the right place, you can actually save a lot of money over the course of a year.

**Charging A Tesla At Home**

Unless you have the benefit of free charging — some early Tesla owners are still eligible for complimentary Supercharger access — connecting your Tesla to your home charging station is likely the most cost-effective method. In North Dakota, you can charge a Tesla Model 3 RWD from completely empty to a full battery for just $7 at home, although this scenario represents the most economical case. North Dakota boasts the lowest average electricity cost in the country, at less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour, and the base Model 3 has a smaller battery than all other Tesla models. In contrast, charging the larger battery of a Model S or Model X with the highest electricity rates in the continental U.S. (at $0.34 per kilowatt-hour in Connecticut) would set you back nearly $40.

However, it's important to note that comparing the cost of charging an EV with filling up a gasoline tank isn't a straightforward apples-to-apples comparison. To get a meaningful perspective, we must consider how far your budget can take you with each type of vehicle. As demonstrated in the table below, you can operate a Tesla for as little as a few cents per mile. For example, an individual covering the national average of 13,500 miles annually while consistently using their home charging station could incur expenses ranging from $405 to $1,755 for charging.

&#x200B;



The precise figures you encounter will naturally fluctuate, influenced by factors such as your local electricity rates and your vehicle's actual efficiency in real-world conditions, which can be impacted by variables like",1696693159.0,2023-10-07 17:39:19,97,93,FionaLooong,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1729a4h/the_cost_of_charging_a_tesla/,True,0.81,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,s2baha,,Ya want tires with that?,"A funny thing I've noticed whenever I take my car—either car, the Roadster or the S—into the service center for any reason:  I’m always told, in concerned tones, that my tires are “almost bald” and should be replaced.

I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever gone in with fresh tires just put on the car, but my tires are not almost bald. I have a gauge, I monitor the tread depth, I recently had the S tires rotated. I know what I’m doing. I’ll get new tires when I need them. And the guys telling me I need new tires never mention any actual tread depth measurement. So what’s going on with these guys?

So, here’s my theory. . . Most Teslas on the road are not that old at this point, and I reckon a very large portion of the work done at the service center is warranty work, which means only cost to Tesla, no revenue. Ah, but if they can sell you some tires! Ka-ching! So I think these guys must be trained to tell everyone they need new tires. Sort of like McDonald’s, “You want fries with that?”

And this is not really a complaint, just something I found amusing. I have doubts about how many Tesla owners actually buy their tires from the Tesla service center anyhow. I’ve never had any urge to do that, since I have been getting my tires for many years from a place that’s much closer to me. I can shop for tires online, have them sent directly to the shop, and it couldn’t be easier.

I do suggest buying a quality pressure gauge and a tread depth gauge and looking after your tires. I mean, there’s not much else on a Tesla that needs careful monitoring. Just keep it plugged in (a plugged-in Tesla is a happy Tesla!) and keep the tires in good shape, and you should be golden.",1642007339.0,2022-01-12 18:08:59,1,3,ZobeidZuma,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/s2baha/ya_want_tires_with_that/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y5o8l4,,"One year review. 25,000 miles cold weather, long cross country and through Canada trips with family, shared daily use, occasional FSD subscriber and one time FSD beta tester and more...","I know there are a lot of these, but before I ordered my Model Y I read ALL of them. It helped me a ton in my decision, so I felt like it was my duty to post one of my own. I hope this might help anyone else who is on the fence or looking for some more details. 

After about a year of research we ordered in June of 2021 and took delivery in October in Western Michigan. Long range no FSD 5 seater. I work from home and travel in state occasionally my wife works about 20 minutes away flex in office and home. We also have an ICE Chrysler Pacifica as our backup vehicle. 

On delivery day like most I was expecting all sorts of issues and panel gaps, squeaks, terrible service and the like. But like most of the real life reviews I see none of that was accurate. The smoothest and easiest delivery and purchase of a vehicle I have ever had. Showed up, got the run down on how to set up the vehicle and we were off. No gaps, no squeaks no issues. Now I was coming from a long history of mid-size SUV vehicles and noting luxury so perhaps I am missing something, however I would never have purchased a luxury vehicle that was not a Tesla. I did not buy it for luxury, I bought it for the software, the gas savings, the safety, and autopilot. I never understood the comparison to other ""luxury"" brands. This is a computer with wheels, not a car. I will say the suspension is a little firm, I have driven sports cars and it feels similar to those. The van feels like we are floating on a cloud in comparison. I understand why it is stiff when I take a corner so fast a regular car would roll, but if you are used to a luxury suspension I could see where you might be disappointed. You can definitely feel the road. 

I had run the wiring to our fuse box for the Tesla wall charger and had an electrician do the final hook up for $250. Signed up for Super Off-Peak Energy (11pm-6am) @ 0.07 to .08/kwh. Overall according to the app we save about $250-$450 a month is gas depending on miles.

post,xwf021,,Was I Wrong to Not Disengage Autopilot?,"Story:
I was driving down the 5 in Washington last night. Empty freeway, no one visible in front of me for miles and several semis I had passed a few hundred feet behind me. I was in the right lane cruising with autopilot going 75 in a 70. 

In the distance, I see police lights on the right shoulder. I preemptively switch to the left lane to give room with autopilot engaged. As I get closer, I see ""Autopilot speed limited for emergency lights"" and the car gradually slows. I thought this was a cool notification I'd never seen before so I decided to stay very vigilant but leave autopilot on to monitor it's behavior. 

Car slows from 75 to 55 over the course of about a quarter mile. 

In doing so, a semi gains on me quickly, changes lanes to the left lane to be right behind me, and comes right up to my bumper. He flashes his lights and honks at me. I step on the accelerator pedal to put some distance between us. 

Was I wrong to let the car slow down? Or was he just an a**? 

The law states that for emergency vehicles on the shoulder, you either need to slow to 55 OR move to the left lane, so I understand being in the left lane AND slowing was a bit extra. Though I don't feel it was unsafe and I certainly didn't do so dramatically enough for the semi to be caught off guard. 

Curious to hear your thoughts

TL:DR, I let autopilot move over and slow for emergency vehicles and a semi behind me didn't like how slow I was driving.

post,wqlx37,,150 miles x2 FSD highway drive 0 phantom braking,"I understand there is a lot of variability between roads and driving environments. I just wanted to post about my flawless FSD highway drive. This is my longest as I don't travel much. I recently traveled to a city 3 hours away. 
I used FSD on the highway and it's amazing how much less stressful the drive is after a few hours of not worrying about lane keeping, Lane changes, or holding speed.

I experienced 0 phantom braking events with overpasses, semi trucks near by or anything else. I was nervous every overpass on the way there and was ready to press to pedal if needed. It just didn't happen. 

On the way home I just relaxed and let the car do it's thing. Drove straight through, and got home relaxed and not exhausted as I normally would after a 3 hour drive. 

When I first got this car, March 2022, occasionally I'd see braking slowdowns on 2 lane roads with a large truck on the opposite lane. At some point this issue also went away with a software update. 

The ONLY time I have unexpected slowdowns is when cresting a steep hill where the car (or my eyes) cannot see what's ahead, and even then it's a minor slowdown not hard braking.

Using FSD also is helpful to prevent speeding tickets. The few times I chose to drive for 5 or 10 minutes on the way to my destination, I'd look at the screen and see I was speeding a bit excessively. It's easy to do as it does not feel like I am traveling at 90mph. 

Unrelated, but choosing a hotel with free charging was fantastic. Starting each day with 90 percent charge for free is so convenient. Checkout day I just got in the car and went home.

post,twad2e,,"Autopilot has not been meaningfully updated for more than 2 years, and still has blatant bugs that need fixing.","It's pretty inexcusable that Autopilot has had major bugs for more than 24 months which have not been addressed by Tesla. They are 100% in on this FSD pipe dream at the expense of the the 99.99% of Tesla owners who want to use Autopilot today.

I understand that they eventually plan on unifying the codebase between FSD and highway-use autopilot, but that is really far off considering that even FSD still defaults back to autopilot code when on the highway.


* [Autopilot sees exit ramps as doublewide lanes](
* Autopilot abruptly cuts closer to semi trucks as soon as it passes
* Autopilot jerks to the center of the lane upon activation
* Autopilot does not accelerate until the lead vehicle has completely left the lane instead of starting to accelerate when they are ~80% out
* Autopilot brakes too hard in stop-and-go traffic and waits too long to accelerate.
* Autopilot blind spot alerts are 95% useless and inaccurate (100% for semis, which fly all over the screen)
* Autopilot still reads MPH signs incorrectly

post,t19772,,FSD Beat 10.10.2 - Model X versus Model 3,"As both my Model X and 3 are synced up on FSD Beta 10.10.2 I wanted to take a moment and do a brief comparison of how the beta runs on both of them.  The Model X biggest the biggest Tesla, and the Model 3 being the smallest, I thought it’d be interesting to see a bit of a comparison is how the beta handles in the different sized vehicles, and the different ages.

I tried to keep the time of day, and the route, as close as possible, however, the cars at time chose different navigation routes to get to destinations, and 

The Model X traveled [this path](  while the Model 3 traveled [this path](   Any deviations in the two routes are the result of the Tesla navigation system deciding to route differently, with the exception of one spot where I force it to go in a different direction.

You can watch the Model X drive using [this link here](  and the Model 3 drive is [here]( 

The Model X is a 2017 with AP 2.5 cameras, and the Model 3 is a 2019 SR+.  Both had their radars turned off when they joined the FSD Beta.  The X is my daily driver, and the 3 is my wife’s daily driver.  This is important to note if you watch the videos because the 3 has *a lot* of accidental disengagements because I wasn’t used to how sensitive it is.  Anyone who says they have a hard time disengaging FSD Beta can go take a hike.  *Super* easy to disengage the thing, which let to a lot of accidental disengagements.

The short and skinny of the experience was:

* The Model X tends to be more uncertain when the roads are narrow, while the Model 3 doesn’t.  Largely because of its size.
* The Model 3 tends to angle the wheels left a bit before it turns right.   The Model X does not.
* The Model X doesn’t have a cabin camera, as such I didn’t get nearly as many nags as the Model 3.  Some of the Model 3 nags were bullshit though.  Hands were *always* on the wheel as torqued as much as possible, while not disengaging.
* The Model X doesn’t automatically turn on auto high beams.  The video above is recor",1645809469.0,2022-02-25 18:17:49,31,0,Nakatomi2010,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/t19772/fsd_beat_10102_model_x_versus_model_3/,True,0.92,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

My thought is they just don't want you treating your Model 3 (or any other) as a Powerwall and they want you to buy Solar/Powerwall instead.

Silly, but I get it. I really hope reverse charging (sorry, can't think of the correct term atm) comes with the Cybertruck as it will probably have thew largest Tesla battery in a vehicle (minus the semi).

post,ryazgo,,FSD & Bad Maps,"So I just finished up my first month of the FSD Subscription, I'm a new Tesla Model 3 owner located in south florida.  3 or 4 days a week I drive from Parkland FL to downtown Miami, a 50 mile drive that covers usually the Florida Turnpike, I95, the Sawgrass expressway, and occasionally I75 and I595 depending on traffic.

You would think these major roads would do great on FSD, but unfortunately it's a mess.  There is construction on I95 (that's been there for months, google maps is aware of the redirects) that aren't properly reflected in the Tesla maps so it's constantly trying to take a right-side offramp which is actually now a left-side offramp.  

In addition, lots of map situations seem to be misunderstood by the tesla.  For example, when the I95 express lanes end, the car wants to merge right onto I95.. But there's no point, as the 2 express lanes simply \_become\_ I95, and I need to exit left in about a mile, so it's just pointless lane changing.

Is there any way to get these maps corrected or updated?  As nice as FSD seems in concept, I really can't use it except for the car-bypass feature. .  Hitting a blinker and letting the car pass a slow semi is fantastic.  I just wish I could get that one feature without the full $200/month as the rest is pretty broken in my neighborhood.

I have 12kw of solar installed 4 Powerwall plus ( technically 2 Powerwall plus and 2 Powerwall's slaved to them ) all in all it cost 57,000$

I love it, this install was part of our move to EV and while it might have been better looking back now to buy the EV's when they were cheaper and wait on the solar we though having the power would be the better way to start. 

since Jan of this year I have bought 100kwh of power total and most of that is from the system checking to make sure the grid is still up which is between .2kwh a day and 1.2 kwh per day.

we don't cut back at all, in fact we kind of intentionally use more power since its worth more locally in the house then the 3 cents I'm getting selling it to pge my AC is set to 65 my pool is set to clean 8 hours a day which keeps it sparkling and we have both sides of our family over a lot so they don't have to run their AC in their home so we still are helping the grid in a way. 

I still have a PGE bill but just for the gas water heater that will get changed out for electric during this project as well. the system works great we had a few power outages in our area that I only know about because my neighbors came over to ask if they could run a extension cord to run their fridge so their food wouldn't spoil which we did.

overall its been amazing and with the tax credit and us saving some money up we are going to have the system paid for in less then 9 months which will save us even more in interest.

post,yspcvl,,Camping/survival enthusiast input needed!!,"Is anyone interested in a solar power “mat” (material will be more like metal rectangles that snap together with magnets) that can charge your car during camping trips/survival situations or expeditions? With the Cyber Truck launching I could see this becoming a neat gimmick that survivalist might like to have. The recent hurricane shows that it is also a nice thing to have if you don’t have power. Obviously it will probably take a lot of hours to charge but if the grid goes down for any situation this would make your car more reliable than gas and super chargers that might go out of service.

I’ve got some mock up designs of a solar array that unstacks and snaps together with magnets to form a mat (very very large mat when assembled). As well as a battery unit for holding and discharging the energy to the car. All of which will be included in a bag that takes up the space of the model 3 trunk storage under the hatch. Might make some designs for one that could potentially fit in the frunk but the shape would be weird but doable. 

Time to charge a car? With enough cells connected to form the mat/array it could charge as fast as you need it to. BUT if you are running low on charge and need it in an emergency you aren’t going to need the full battery to get to ur destination. In a survival/out in the middle of no where situation this is much better than never making it there if you are unable to make the trek physically or aren’t wanting to walk miles and miles. You could utilize very few solar cells and charge the car just a few miles to get to a charger if your car were to die. 

Is this something anyone would even be interested in? 
Would it be more practical to have a battery that is backup and can be used to charge the car/truck?

When they announced that they were bringing the Solar Roof to Canada in 2017, I immediately put an order down with a fully refundable deposit of $1300 CAD. It was announced to start installations in 2018, and I thought ""why not"", as we needed a new roof soon anyways.

However, 2018 passed and we never heard anything. At the time, the consensus from the internet was that they were still working on it. However, more time passed, and its crickets. We weren't too fussed, but we chased up every now and again via e-mail for years. We never had a \*single\* response.

Earlier this year, I decided enough was enough. So, I put in a cancellation request through the ""My Account"" page, and all I was given is that we would be contacted about the cancellation. However, we were never contacted (surprise, surprise). Mind you, by this time, the AMEX we used to pay was long expired (it's been about five years since we placed the order). And, frustratingly, every email, phone call (never reaches a human), Tweet, Facebook post was to no avail.  So, we even sent in a physical letter by UPS overseas to the Texas headquarters.

I am sure if someone just checks their records, they will easily see that we are owed a refund. But, of course, no one ever got back to us.

It seems that we have no option but to file a small claims case in the state of Texas. Normally, I would avoid to be litigious, but I can't think of anything else to do.

post,rx6jl4,,Financing a Tesla Model 3,"First time financing a car so I really appreciate the help!

I'm financing a Model 3 soon, and I'm confused on the importance of downpayments. I've heard of the 20% rule but looking at how a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment affects the total cost of the car over the 72 months, it seems like a large downpayment could be split into investing the money into stocks and crypto, and I can just go off the bare minimum downpayment. Other than the lower monthly payment and avoiding depreciation of the car, I don't see the importance of a huge downpayment.

MSRP of the car is $46490 with my design. A 10% downpayment is about $4.5k, and this puts the total cost of the car over 72 months at $51084. 20% downpayment (\~$9.1k) has a total cost of $50716. Finally, a huge 50% downpayment (\~$23k) has a total cost of $49640. These numbers were all calculated on Tesla's website using their downpayment adjustment and multiplying 72x the monthly payment. These total costs have such a narrow range of cost difference for the huge downpayment ranges. APR rate is 2.49% for all costs.

My confusion comes in over why you wouldn't just choose a bare minimum downpayment and throw most of your money stocks or crypto. I'm sure I could easily make up that $500-1500 price difference of total cost by investing the $4.5k (or a huge chunk of the $23k) into stocks like $AAPL or $TSLA. Even BTC or ETH would have great yields over a 2-3 year timeline.

**TL;DR**: Wouldn't a huge downpayment be better split into a minimum downpayment with the other portion of money going into investments? This is assuming the price range of the total cost is very narrow, regardless of a 10%, 20%, or 50% downpayment.",1641446534.0,2022-01-06 06:22:14,4,15,bigfdapresident68,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rx6jl4/financing_a_tesla_model_3/,True,0.7,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,a2pblp,,"I wonder why EV car vendors went for DC supply, total opposite of railways?","I wonder why EV car vendors went for DC charging? I mean for electrified railways, the trend has been a total opposite. The 1500V and 3000V DC catenary wire systems, where conversion from the national AC grid happens via track-side rectifier substations placed every ~12km (max. 20km), such systems are now considered obsolete.

New contruction happens with 25kV AC catenary, fed directly from the national grid via transformers located ~60km apart and the conversion to DC (and then on to 3-phase AC traction motors) is performed ONBOARD the locomotives. Some countries, like Czechia and Slovakia are even taking down their 3kV DC wires and replacing them with 25kV AC, which is now the UIC world standard. Even in entrenched DC catenary countries, like France and Italy, high-speed train lines are built for AC traction.

Yet, for some reason the BEV car industry is betting on ""trackside"" AC to DC conversion, with ""well-heads"" feeding DC to e-cars, rather than relying on e-cars to receive AC and rectify it onboard. That surely cannot scale beyond a certain BEV car population size?

For example one Tesla Supercharger stall uses 12 (twelve) universal rectifier racks to serve just one car with full power DC and another with reduced power DC. In contrast, Tesla cars have a single rectifier rack of the same type onboard (rarely two, with an extra priced option). As the Tesla model 3 is predicted to become the new ""Ford model T"" and millions of such cars hit the roads, Supercharger infrastructure must grow exponentially and rectifier rack production must even surpass that 12x times to keep up.

Sometime there won't be enough sand left to melt silicone at that pace... All the mobile phone, PC, TV, etc. electronic factories worldwide would also need to be shut down and converted to power-electronics business to be able to build enough rectifier racks.

post,9oqwzd,,US Electric Vehicle Sales Hit One Million,"### Electric Vehicle Sales Hit New Milestone

Sometime in October 2018, electric vehicle sales in the United States hit 1 million. Consequently, the future’s never looked brighter for clean energy technologies. However, EVs still account for just 1% of total US auto sales.

The 3rd quarter of 2018 saw record sales numbers. To the surprise of some, over 110,000 EVs were sold during that period. Furthermore, the steadily growing industryis making it easier for new owners to get on board. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s stepping down as Tesla Executive Chairman marks a new chapter for electric cars in the US.

Most importantly, that clean energy transportation no longer has a figurehead that is a public company director. However the industry appears to be sustaining itself. And much work needs to be done.

### A Long Way To Go

The United States is not the global leader in electric vehicle adoption. That distinction belongs to China, a country whose government subsidises EV purchases. While Beijing leads the clean energy battle, Europe is also taking steps to advance its own EV industry. Portugal is positioned to become the continent’s leading lithium producer, and the EU has set lofty sustainability targets.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s upcoming gigafactory could change the EV landscape for years to come. Despite a 2018 production ramp-up, demand severely outpaces supply. This is good news for an industry and company aimed at reducing global carbon emissions.

### Lithium’s Part

While Tesla’s gigafactory is placed in Nevada for a number of reasons (including tax incentives), one factor stands out. Namely, the country’s largest lithium mine. Located just 150 miles north of the Gigafactory, this reserve will play a major part in powering electric vehicles throughout the country.

However, most of the world’s lithium still comes from South America’s Lithium Triangle. Spanning Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, this region owns 54% of the world’s lithium. If America hopes to reach 5 million EV",1539718088.0,2018-10-16 21:28:08,20,11,UltraLithiumTeam,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/9oqwzd/us_electric_vehicle_sales_hit_one_million/,True,0.86,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

But most of all he likes to harp on the Chevy Volt. He enjoys touting a claim that the government bought 10,000 Volts to boost sales numbers. He also said that a lot of the Volt batteries caught fire. Is there any truth to these claims?

A quick Google search shows there was a lot of controversy surrouding the Volt when it arrived in 2011. A lot of talk about government subsidies, etc. But my question is, is the Volt really deserving of all this controversy? Or is all that old news and is the Volt now able to stand on its own two feet, so to speak? Is my FIL just using old headlines about the Volt to convince himself EVs are bad?

\*\*EDIT\*\*

Thank you everyone for all the information! I'm glad to know that the voice of reason at the back of my head telling me that the ""government buying 10,000 Volts"" doesn't sound accurate, was correct.

Unfortunately, I don't own an electric vehicle and none my close family or friends have one either, so I don't have one in the driveway for him to try out. I like the idea of taking him to the dealer for a test drive, but the trick will be getting him to believe it is worth his time. I'm hoping to get an EV soon.

Is he running all these companies remotely or is there one company that he goes to physically every day and is the boss of like normal bosses? I know he can't be everywhere at once, so I wonder.

Does he actually go to work at Twitter/Tesla, etc? Where is his current home base?

post,kt91qk,,"Signal Private Messenger team here, we support an app used by everyone from Elon to the Hong Kong protestors to our Grandpa’s weekly group chat, AMA!","Hi everyone,

We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world. Between WhatsApp announcing they would be sharing everything with the Facebook mothership and the Apple privacy labels that allowed people to compare us to other popular messengers, it seems like many people are interested in private communication. 

Some quick facts about us: we are an open-sourced nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring private and secure communication to anyone and everyone. One of the reasons we opted for organizing as a nonprofit is that it aligned with our want to create a business model for a technology that wasn’t predicated on the need for personal data in any way. 

As an organization we work very hard to not know anything about you all. There aren’t analytics in the app, we use end to end encryption for everything from your messages and calls/video as well as all your metadata so we have no idea who you talk to or what you talk about.

We are very excited for all the interest and support, but are even more excited to hear from you all. 

We are online now and answering questions for at least the next 3 hours (in between a whole bunch of work stuff). If you are coming to this outside of the time-window don't worry please still leave a question, we will come back on Monday to answer more. 

-Jun

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the questions and comments, we always learn a tremendous amount and value the feedback greatly. We are going to go back to work now but will continue to monitor and check in periodically and then will do another pass on Monday.",1610132234.0,2021-01-08 19:57:14,5212,2124,signal_app,technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/kt91qk/signal_private_messenger_team_here_we_support_an/,True,0.97,2021,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,14aicet,,who knows about the tesla battery and motor compatibility of the original tesla roadster and a model 3?,"this probably isnt the subreddit to ask but the 2 subreddits dedicated to this car are both under 50 people, are basically vacant, and only approved people can post, so ill have to do it here hoping someone knowledgeable can advise me on this

so I found this surprisingly affordable 2008 tesla roadster and I started thinking about the possibility of doing a motor and possibly a battery swap with a more modern tesla.

&#x200B;

The battery portion would obviously be a lot of work, but with how modular tesla batteries are, it might be possible to take it all apart to its bare cells, and basically reconstruct the battery with a new battery housing following the basic structure of the original casing, only made to fit the shape of the one found int he roadster. that of course would be quite difficult, but my question is would it be doable. and probably the easier side of the equation, a model s or model 3 motor swap. i would have to get one that didn't have 2 speed transmission to ""simplify"" things, but would it be possible and would i or would i not be incredibly frowned upon for doing that to a roadster. and the last thing and the easiest of all, since i would be replacing the battery and the motor, might as well upgrade the charge port to NACS as well.

So, if there are any knowledgeable tesla roadster owners out there in this thread or at least someone who knows a good deal about the tesla roadster, how possible would this be. its a very analog car, so i imagine there wouldnt be too much software interference, but of course, adding a new drivetrain and battery might not take too kindly to the old computers in the car. and im assuming the likelihood of this being possible is near zero since many tesla roadsters were actually taken apart in order to use them for parts to fix existing tesla roadsters, but doesnt hurt to ask.",1686875586.0,2023-06-16 02:33:06,1,8,AvailableProgram667,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/14aicet/who_knows_about_the_tesla_battery_and_motor/,True,0.67,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18giwrj,,"FSD ""Minimal Lane Changes"" is meaningless","I do declare the Minimal Lane Changes feature is meaningless and dangerous. Both of these scenarios  were in the same conditions on the same stretch of suburban interstate - FSD with navigation on, configured for ""chill"" with ""minimal lane changes"", speed set within ~1 MPH of traffic, riding in the slow lane, moderate traffic moving a few MPH below the speed limit.

Scenario 1

1 mile until planned exit. Passing lane isn't really passing. Slow lane is full of semi trucks ahead, so passing is pointless - passing maybe one truck to struggle to get back over to exit isn't worth it. So I turn on the turn signal to get into the slow lane and wait it out. Adjust autopilot speed to equal slow lane speed. 15 seconds pass. Half a mile to the exit. No merging traffic. Autopilot turns on left signal to get back in the passing lane. 

WHY? How many different ways do I have to tell it I don't want to get over? I'm already travelling at the desired speed. Getting over will guarantee I miss my exit. 

Scenario 2

This one is worse. I had to intervene to prevent an accident. Similar to the previous, but 5 miles until my exit. Passing lane isn't consistently moving faster - just more volatile acceleration and deceleration from cars changing lanes and folks not paying attention. Again, I'd rather wait it out in the slow lane than participate in the rat race. You know...*chill*. FSD is following the next car just fine. No merging traffic.
Some cars are sporadically passing quickly just to hit their brakes because the passing lane traffic is moving at close to the same speed as me. As one car changes lanes and accelerates hard to get nowhere like a dummy, FSD turns on the left signal and changes lanes and doesn't wait the usual half second before initiating the actual move. This is a direct collision course with the other car, so I override.

I get that this is a beta product, but it's downright dangerous and embarrassing. I don't let FSD deal with the difficult stuff - unprotected lef",1702376857.0,2023-12-12 11:27:37,33,42,OhmsLolEnforcement,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/18giwrj/fsd_minimal_lane_changes_is_meaningless/,True,0.79,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,18a53cm,,Autopilot slowing down for side roads,"Has anyone noticed since around 2023.38.6 that Autopilot will sometimes slow down for intersecting side roads, even if you have right of way? 

As an example, I take a semi-rural undivided 100km/h road to my local city as part of my commute. Along the way, there are a few side roads that intersect with the main road, but those roads have a giveway to the main road so there's no need to slow down for them. It doesn't do it for every side road, but there are a few that it will do it for consistently, despite no car being at the intersection.

As mentioned, it started happening for me with 2023.38.6 and with 2023.44.1 it has now started doing it for a couple more roads. It's not a sudden slam of the brakes or anything, just a gradual reduction in speed as we approach as if it's getting ready to take that side road.

post,16zwzmz,,"Just completed a roadtrip Florida to Minnesota, Tesla Model 3 Review","So, I just travelled from Orlando to Minnesota (for the Minnesota Ren Fest) and back. Along the way, I took a detour to the Land between the Lakes in Tennessee on the way North, and to Mingo Falls in North Carolina on the way South.

**The Route:**

Originally, I had planned to start the trek through Land Between the Lakes just west of Dover, but the closest supercharger is in Dickson, which is \*just\* outside of the range of my standard range Tesla Model 3 to make it to the next supercharger in Kuttawa, so I settled for entering Land Between the Lakes at the halfway point, and going all the way north through that, taking some side roads to check it out.

On the route south, I ended up taking a detour east through the Smoky Mountain National Park, and going to Mingo Falls in Cherokee, NC, then taking the Blue Ridge Parkway further east through to Colombia, SC to meet up with a friend for lunch, then back to Orlando.

**Charging:**

In general, a full (90-100%) charge gave me 2.1 to 2.6 hours of driving time before arriving at the next Supercharger. This highly depended on how Rural I was getting. The area between Tennessee and Minnesota is a weird split of things: Every supercharger I had plenty of stalls to choose from \*but\* the locations available were very sparse. I'm talking 45 min to 1 hour between every SC. While I didn't need to travel far from the highway, if I wanted to stray off the highway for some exploration, my distance was limited. I'd say I was only \*slightly\* limited.

The thing as well when you're travelling this long range, you have two choices when charging:

1. Charge to what it says and get on the road immediately, but go to more stops (you'll leave the charger between 60-90% usually).
2. Charge to 90% and get more time at the stop, and less stops.

Under most situations, I opted for option #2 because it gave me 30-35 minutes to take a nap, which was a really good thing since I was driving solo. Also, napping in the driver's seat at stops ",1696449617.0,2023-10-04 22:00:17,33,10,Imper1um,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/16zwzmz/just_completed_a_roadtrip_florida_to_minnesota/,True,0.87,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15khqxz,,Tesla Semi is crazy cheap to operate.,"If Pepsi Co is getting better than 1.7kWh/mile and utility electrical rates are about 13.50 cents/kWh (actual rate from a California Pepsi Co location), then we're talking under 23 cents/mile.

Meanwhile, the diesel trucks are lucky to get 7MPG, meaning they would have to get diesel at under $1.60 just to break even on fuel. Diesel is over $5.25 in the same area that the $13.50 electrical rate is, costing more than 3.3 times as much.

Even if you look at a less sweetheart industrial electricity deal and use a pricy $0.20 (this is high for industrial, even in California), it's just $0.34/mile which is equivalent to diesel costing $2.38/gallon and it's still more than double that. Even assuming the charging is only 80% efficient the trucks are super cheap to run compared to diesel.

Pepsi is paying about $125 in electricity to go that 450 miles while the diesel truck is taking about $335 in diesel and that's generously assuming 7mi/gallon even though the mountain pass isn't getting that. I've seen estimates as low as 4MPG for the trucks PepsiCo replaced, but I haven't seen them speak to that.

Then you have maintenance, which we know is lower on the electric truck. The trucks are paying for themselves in under 1000 trips, probably inside of 3 years.",1691406972.0,2023-08-07 13:16:12,315,208,CapinWinky,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/15khqxz/tesla_semi_is_crazy_cheap_to_operate/,True,0.86,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,14umkh9,,FSD Beta 11.4.5,"- Improved short-deadline lane changes, to avoid going off-route, through better modeling of target lane vehicles to improve gap selection assertiveness.

- Improved offset consistency when controlling for static obstacles. Also improved smoothness when changing offset direction by adjusting speed more comfortably.

- Improved handling of oncoming cars on narrow unmarked roads by improving prediction of oncoming car's trajectory and leaving enough room for them to pass before re-centering.

- Improved Occupancy Flow prediction from the Occupancy Network for arbitrary moving obstacles by 8%.

- Expanded usage of the new object ground truth autolabeler for the NonVRU detection model, improving distant vehicle recall and geometry precision for semi-trucks, trailers, and exotic vehicles.

- Improved VRU control by expanding planning scope to control gently for low-confidence detections that may interfere with ego's path.

- Improved handling for VRUs near crosswalks by predicting their future intent more accurately. This was done by leveraging more kinematic data to improve association between crosswalks and VRUs.

- Improved ego's behavior near VRUs by tuning their assumed kinematic properties and utilizing available semantic information to classify more accurately their probability of intersecting ego's path.

post,14efnka,,"Some thoughts on FSD after a 1,400 mile road trip","Was on a trip down to Salt Lake City.  Nice to get some long distance driving in on the Interstates instead of being stuck on Montana Highways.  Noticed some behaviors while I was driving.

First:  Follow distance has been removed.  This annoys me greatly.

Second:  Automatic lane changing cannot be disabled, only dialed down.

Third:  When passing another vehicle, if someone is behind you the Tesla immediately pulls over to allow them to pass.

Fourth:  When passing another vehicle and nobody is behind you, the Tesla will remain in the left lane until the heat death of the universe.

Fifth:  FSD sucks donkey balls in the HOV lane.  The only time it wanted to get out of the left lane was when I was in the HOV lane.  Every 30 seconds it tried to initiate a lane change.  It even tried swerving through double white lines with only half a second warning.  Even when nobody was behind me, it wanted to get out of the HOV lane.  It even tried to merge right into another car in the lane to my right.

FSD handled the Interstate just fine.  But when the Interstate turned into a Freeway, FSD was out of it's mind.

Phantom braking is still a massive annoyance on highways.  Warning light, braking.  Slight curve that a semi could take with a full load at full speed?  Better start braking.  Warning light that isn't flashing.  Better slam on the brakes.  No traffic ahead of me or behind me.  Better change lanes.  Braking speed for speed limit reduction is a massive improvement since last year.  I no longer fear getting speeding tickets when I enter small towns along the highway.  Though Tesla still has trouble identifying certain speed signs.  Oh, and it still confuses Highway 35 as Speed Limit 35.

We were test-driving a Model 3... Handed a key by the sales attendant and was given the basics for driving the car, everything started off great! I thought to myself ""Wow this is so high-tech, no attendant with us in the car?"".

Well... we got rear-ended at a traffic circle entrance... 100% the other driver's fault (they accepted the blame and were very friendly and extremely nice). The Tesla did not register what happened as an accident, and no airbags were deployed, but when we tried to get the car driving back again it would not engage in drive because it said the frunk and trunk were both open. Stuck in the middle of a traffic circle I got out and opened and slammed each the frunk and trunk but the computer still registered them as unlocked and would not resume driving.

911 was called as we were blocking the middle of a super busy and dangerous traffic circle and were unable to move the car, but they never ended up showing up in the 45 minutes we were sitting.

I called the number for the dealership we test drove from (found in the email confirmation for test drive), no way to contact a human. There was also no way to contact roadside support from the car itself. I had to call the Tesla roadside support number (I am not a Tesla owner, I don't have the app) but TESLA THEMSELVES COULD NOT GET IN TOUCH WITH THE DEALERSHIP TO LET THEM KNOW WE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT! Since the car was unable to drive, and Tesla Roadside was not able to contact the dealership (which was less than 2 miles away), and since 911 couldn't help us to safety, the roadside assistance used the VIN of the car which I had to locate to remotely override the safety features and allow us to drive back to the dealership.

I saw some say that Tesla's don't ""coast"", my daily is a manual and coasting is a way of life. Is this something I need to consciously not do or can't do? 

Anything else I should be watch out for as a first time EV driver? I'm no stranger to fast cars but the Model S I will be renting makes my cars 0-60 look downright pedestrian so if any additional caution should be taken I'd like to know! 

Any charging tips would also be appreciated, I mean it does seem straightforward but anything I should *not* do or stuff to be on the lookout for, especially being a rented vehicle, want to make sure not to ""oops"" anything. 

Thanks!

One pedal driving actually sounds amazing, I'm looking forward to a nice vacation and enjoying the ride!

Edit 2 - post driving

Alrighty. Had a good vacation and time to ruminate on the driving experience. Just gonna do pros cons. 

Pros: 
One pedal driving was cool and pretty easy to get used to

Quick acceleration made me feel right at home, could maneuver on a dime at any time. 

Shockingly solid and smooth at excessive speeds, smoother than my M4 at 120+ easily. 

The model S is sexy. Body and class. It just looks great. 

Supercharging was quick and easy, also super cheap. 

Autopark is dope. Easily the smoothest auto parking mechanism I've ever seen. 

The Auto door unlock when you are close with your phone is cool. 

Cons:

post,12k733x,,2022.45.15 isn't great,"I know there's some angry typing already occurring because...this is reddit, but let me explain.

When I started in FSD Beta, I was genuinely impressed. I had a hard time understanding the criticism towards FSD because of how well it worked.

Since ive installed 2022.45.15 , I fond myself engaging FSD less and less.

Since installation, my car tried to T-bone a parked van while making a left turn. It even started alerting the forward collision alert, I still had to take over.

Today it blew right through a stop light, which is something ive read about but never experienced until this update.

It tries to dart right into traffic making an unprotected left turn.

It swerves into other lanes trying to avoid semis and buses even if they are appropriately in their lane.

There is a specific right turn near my work where the car drives off onto the shoulder and straight at a curb.

Ive also noticed a strange glitch where I try to toggle into FSD , the car makes the sound as if its engaged, and it does not actually engage ( this has happened several times now)

Ive also noticed that being able to engage FSD is harder, I have to drive quite a bit out of my neighborhood before im given the option now.

Ive been very happy with FSD until now, which is crazy because it seems like most other reviewers are having the opposite experience.

Also, the less steering wheel nag is blatantly false, I stare straight ahead, no sunglasses, no phone,while driving and get the nag as much as I did on other stacks. 

Im curious if anyone else has had a similar experience? The car running the stop light caused me to stop using it entirely ( just happened today so take it for what it's worth)

I have noticed that I have not gotten any phantom braking with this stack, though I've only had it for a short time.

The visuals are also fantastic and slowing to a stop at red lights ( when not running them) feels more natural than previous stacks.

post,11oqibn,,FSD Beta 10.69.25.2 is still impressive in its own right.,"I drove my 2022 Model Y to the Tampa, FL service center this morning.  The more I use FSD Beta, the more impressed I am with it.

Lately I've turned on the ""Auto lane change"" function in Navigate on Autopilot, and have noticed that, despite it being a little slow to execute the lane change on its own, it's still quite solid.  The main reason I turned it on is because FSD Beta v11 won't let us turn it off, so it's better to get used to the behavior now.

The path driven was [this](  For the entire duration of the drive, I did not have to disengage Autopilot.  Admittedly, this drive was between 6:20am and 7am, so there wasn't a whole lot of traffic on the road to start with, but still.

There were a few interventions though.  Like [this one]( where with no oncoming traffic the car stuttered, [because there's a bunch of trees blocking visibility]( plus it's an interstate onramp, which I like to floor it on anyways, so I'm not sure I want to count this as an intervention, but I hit the accelerator to scoot it across, then floored it up to 75mph.

Then I didn't touch anything until I got off the interstates.  The car handled negotiating traffic, took the I-4 to I-75 junction, negotiated more traffic, got off at Fowler, and I intervened again by aborting a lane change.  [The Y followed the path of the red arrow]( and wanted to change lanes, however, doing so would have put me in front of a semi truck, and shortened their braking distance, so I aborted that lane change as I felt that was a dick move, plus my traffic lanes were shorter, so the lane change didn't really make sense.

The whole reason for going to the service center was to drop my wife's 3 off for service, so while he had gotten separated earlier, because FSD Beta ran a yellow, and my wife got the red, she caught up to me at the above intersection, and we stayed together to the service center.  Because she was behind me, further along Fowler Ave, near University Mall, so that my wife wouldn't get shorted in la",1678557569.0,2023-03-11 18:59:29,13,1,Nakatomi2010,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/11oqibn/fsd_beta_1069252_is_still_impressive_in_its_own/,True,0.74,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,11lsnob,,Tesla FSD Beta v11.3.1 / Release 2022.45.10 release notes,"The rest of the notes are the usual Full Self-Driving (Beta), Driving Visualization Improvements and Full Self Driving (Beta) Suspension The notes for v11.3.1 differ slightly from those previously predicted:

&#x200B;

* Enabled FSD Beta on highway. This unifies the vision and planning stack on and off-highway and replaces the legacy highway stack, which is over four years old. The legacy highway stack still relies on several single-camera and single-frame networks, and was setup to handle simple lane-specific maneuvers. FSD Beta's multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.
* Improved recall for close-by cut-in cases by 15%, particularily for large trucks and high-yaw rate scenarios, through an additional 30k auto-labelled clips mined from the fleet. Additionally, expaned and tuned dedicated speed control for cut-in objects.
* Improved the position of ego in wide lanes, by biasing in the direction of the upcoming turn to allow other cars to maneuver around ego.
* Improved handling during scenarios with high curvature or large trucks by offsetting in lane to maintain safe distances to other vehicles on the road and increase comfort.
* Improved behavior for path blockage lane changes in dense traffic. Ego will now maintain more headway in blocked lanes to hedge for possible gaps in dense traffic.
* Improved lane changes in dense traffic scenarios by allowing higher acceleration during the alignment phase. This results in more natural gap selection to overtake adjacent lane vehicles very close to ego.
* Made turns smoother by improving the detection consistency between lanes, lines and road edge predictions. This was accomplished by integrating the latest version of the lane-guidance module into the road edge and lines network.
* Improved accuracy for detecting other vehicles' moving semantics. ",1678270612.0,2023-03-08 11:16:52,61,36,JonG67x,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/11lsnob/tesla_fsd_beta_v1131_release_20224510_release/,True,0.98,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,10mpmvs,,"Quick thoughts on 10.69.25.1 on my camera retrofitted Model S (plus Radar vs Vision, BlueCruise)","So, as some of you know, I have a 17 S with AP2.0 cameras that only joined the beta close to the New Year. As a result it’s been still using radar fusion autopilot even up to the Holiday Update. At the same time we have a new Lightning truck with BlueCruise. We put 300 miles on each weekly so with a few thousand miles under my belt I’m ready to share some thoughts. 

**FSD Beta**

-	FSDBeta 10.69.25.1/2: much much improved. It’s been great seeing the journey from the first beta 3 we got a year ago to today. Kudos to the FSD team, what you have done is not easy. Very optimistic this will eventually converge into something as useful as NoA or more. 
-	I wanna give Tesla a lot of credit for (1) being one of a kind in the offering. Literally no other car I can buy has the equivalent function. (2) my 2017 car bought while Chris Lattner was in charge and delivering drunken garbage now runs FSDBeta with no additional money from me. In that sense I appreciate the value of the $3000 FSD package. 
-	Safety related interventions: mostly fall into two buckets for me: one is coming too close to curbing the wheels on turns. The other is attempting to make a turn when in my opinion it’s unsafe. Usually it’s not going to cause a collision but it does rely on the other party braking. Maybe I’m old fashioned but I never believe it’s polite or proper to perform a maneuver requiring the right-of-way party to accommodate me, unless there’s really no other choice like a zipper merge. 
-	Correctness interventions are still very frequent. It often doesn’t get in correct lanes or drives in an inappropriate part of the road, like occupying a bike lane or attempting to make a turn that blocks the straight traffic when it could’ve pulled further aside. 
-	Driver comfort is still quite lacking. In just a mundane straight drive on Montague Expressway (a busy 50mph 5 lane wide city street in Silicon Valley), I get 3 or so FCWs on a 10 mile commute which don’t have any explanation.

post,10mm9o9,,"[2023 Model 3] I'm unsubscribing from FSD because its unsafe, uncomfortable, and breaks traffic laws.","The title isn't exaggerating: FSD Beta, to be honest, is not made for consumers. It definitely shouldn't be used anywhere except the highways. I've loved everything about my Tesla... except for FSD which has severely disappointed me, so I'm unsubscribing. I'll go over each of the issues I have with the FSD system.

For background, my Tesla is a 2023 Model 3, purchased on December 31, 2022. I drive in Orlando, Florida, primarily, but I've driven to Miami and back on FSD Mode for testing long range highway driving. I subscribed to FSD on January 12. I got FSD Beta on January 13, and I used FSD Beta on the drive back from Miami. In total, I've driven 1,860 Miles, roughly 50-60% of those miles in some kind of Auto-mode. Here's my Autopilot and Software Screens for reference:  [ 

TL;DR: Tesla FSD drives like a 17-year-old overly-careful driver, trying to pass a driver's test at times, and a drunk driver at others, leading me to want to just unsubscribe.

# It's Unsafe

One of the issues that I have with the FSD Beta is that it requires that you need to take over with a moment's notice, and usually as the thing that is requiring the FSD Beta for human takeover is happening. This could be a failed merge into highway traffic, as its about to cross the line into the shoulder, which has a barrier right after the short shoulder. This also happened that there was two rights close to each other when I was supposed to go to the highway: one 90 degree right turn into a side street, the second (correct right) is a slight, 45 degree right turn:

&#x200B;



The intention was that I merged onto I-4 using the Blue Line. Tesla was operating at the assumption that we would be taking the near-full-speed 45 MPH turn that the blue line was meant for. At the last second, it decided that it wanted to take the Red Line... at 45 MPH... and swing very wide. As someone that is hopeful but skeptical of FSD Beta, I was holding the steering wheel for the intended blue line.

post,15ey8ky,,Alternative to Drive on sunshine (excess solar charging),"Drive on Sunshine is great for those with powerwalls. For those that didn't have powerwalls chargeHQ was a good alternative but now you have to pay $7 a month to utilize the solar charging feature. There are a few scripts out there on GitHub that allow this but I was hoping for something a little more polished. 

After much searching I stumbled across [evcc.io]( which I haven't really seen discussed much in the community. The documentation is mostly in German but using the translate feature I was able to get through it and set up my Tesla to dynamically charge from excess solar output communicating to my Enphase gateway.

Setup has a guided configuration which helps if you don't want to compose the yaml file yourself. 

It supports Tesla as well as many other vehicles, connects with the wall charger and uses Tesla refresh tokens to connect to the vehicle and it all stays local on your machine for those that don't like to share auto tokens to external services.

post,15debrz,,Powerwall 2 and 3rd Party Solar PV,"Hi,

I've a question about the App and control of the Powerwall.

When  in **Self powered mode** the powerwall uses it's stored energy when the  solar panels cannot provide for the house, or at night. But the  powerwall won't recharge from the grid during cheap rate times. (I have cheap rate supply from 2330 - 0530)

I  have to switch to **time-based control** to charge the powerwall fully. In this mode the powerwall provides the supply to the house during the day but diverts my solar to the grid, not the house or the battery.



Is there a problem with the way my Powerwall has been set up? (new install). Or do i have to change modes morning and evening to get a fresh battery fill overnight and use my panels for the house during the day?",1690698519.0,2023-07-30 08:28:39,1,6,Ledgund,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/15debrz/powerwall_2_and_3rd_party_solar_pv/,True,1.0,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,117swn5,,My first new 2023 Tesla Model X! I'm in love!,"[

&#x200B;

I just picked up my first Tesla 2023 Model X 4 days ago and I'm loving every second of driving it!! We've already put on 700+ miles driving it everywhere.

I got the white exterior, white seats, 7-seat configuration, 20-inch wheels for better range, and FSD on it.

&#x200B;

I picked it up with 5 miles on it. Unfortunately, it did have some damage on the front, some big paint chips. And a little hole in the front passenger door leather but it's all aesthetics so it wasn't a big deal for me. I already have it scheduled with my local SC to get re-painted and fixed. I also expected some damage on it as I thought somebody ordered it and rejected it but was more surprised that was it.

&#x200B;

I believe I have the USS on it as I have the sensors on the front and rear bumper, the inch sensors when close to objects when parking, and the following features - summon, smart summon, and auto park. I've tested them all except the summon. 

Seeing the smart summon and auto park in action made me jump like a little kid! It was awesome to witness. 

I also have the FSD and I got it for free. My dad-in-law works at Tesla and it was an employee perk. All we needed to claim was to have him on as the co-applicant in the finance and registration and he had to reserve it under his tesla email so the car is in his tesla app account and we had to be added as drivers. Again, not a big deal either, just annoying to have to log in to his tesla app to look at our supercharging history. A workaround though is to have my own tesla on my ""personal island"" on my android phone, and his tesla app on the ""work island"" so I can open both at the same time as well.

&#x200B;

Overall, I'm very happy we pulled the trigger, my finger's been in the trigger well for the last 3 months. It wasn't really in the plan to have this car until 12-24 months since we just got our solar, span, and powerwalls 3 months ago. And of course, my solar is now undersized due to this car.

post,10qcuyn,,Tesla Solar application to installation timeframe?,"So I recently started looking into solar and met with a local solar rep here in Colorado. They gave me a quote for a 9.88 kW system and it seemed pretty high. I hadn't looked into Tesla Solar in quite some time but part of doing some due diligence (combined with desire to have everything in one app) I decided to look them up as well. Seems like their solar panel system is much cheaper even with 2 powerwalls. So naturally I wanted to inquire more. The solar rep who gave me my first quote said that ""Tesla panels have been halted due current lawsuits and there's no telling if/when they will be installed."" I can't find anywhere online that seems to indicate this to be true. So I'm looking to the experts for some insight on the following:  


\- Does what the rep told me hold any truth? I know there were some lawsuits in 2022 for bait and switch but no indication that this is halting installs.

post,69rh16,,My affordable JDM hero story,"Ok, so this is the post that everyone asked me to make. Here goes 30 minutes of my life. Around 12 months ago, I needed a car to replace my worn out Camry. Naturally being the 20 year old car enthusiast I am, I wanted a sports car. I cross shopped dozens of coupes, being nearly obsessed with each one of them for a period of time. 300ZX, RX-8, FC RX-7, MK3 Supras, MK1 and 2 MR2's. The list goes on and on. And then I came across a car I hadn't thought much about before. A Lexus SC. The Wheel of Random Obsession stopped spinning and I fell in love. The looks, the motors, the luxury. I loved it all. 

Now, at the time, these cars were remarkably cheap. The prices had bottomed out, but the examples for sale were in such god awful condition. Multi colored panels. Mismatched wheels. Ripped up interiors. 250,000+ miles. An immaculate SC300 factory 5 speed did show up, but to the tune of $15,000. And saving up 1,500-3,000 in cash for the other terrible examples wasn't in my best interest at the time. For months I waited, checking craigslist and auto trader every week until I found the perfect SC for me. Around three months had passed and I had passed up offers for many ""normal"" cars for pretty good prices. I was determined to get the car I wanted, and I would wait for it. Unlike a normal person, I would not buy the first crappy car that came along. It had to be special. 

Two more months pass. I am pretty drained on car shopping at this point. For five months I have saved money working at a shitty truck stop and still no SC. My Camry was dead and I needed a new car. Time was running out, and it looked like I had lost the game. I had to settle for less. So I offered to buy my Dad's Explorer Sport Trac. A decent truck, he offered to let me buy it for $500 down and pay him the rest of the payments on it. For a week I drove this truck, and I was about to buy it. I was actually somewhat content with it. But it was not the car I wanted to buy, more forced to out of bad luck.

post,694gnx,,Japan Car Scene as a Tourist on Vacation,"Okay, First off...

This is my first time to Japan, and i went with one semi-car guy and one car noob. I didn't plan on making the trip about cars but i knew i was going to take pictures of cars (and make one special trip to actually look them out). I was going to post this in the /r/Japantravel guide since they helped me with my trip (big shout out to that sub). However, people post pictures there all the time, and i think you guys would appreciate it more (even though i may still do it). **First**, i'm from the united states and i live in the midwest but i have traveled. I've seen all kinds of cars from low budget to exotics, but not many foreign cars other than traditional imports. So i may have some cars that seem like ""regular"" everyday cars (specially in Australia and the UK), but I have never seen them. I'm a big believer in all cars can be beautiful and are ""cool"" so it's a mix of all kinds of cars (even bikes). Also, although i consider myself a ""car"" guy, i'm LEAGUES behind you guys and have trouble knowing car models and types, so bare with me. **Second**, I'll try and keep it car related, as this is what this sub is for, but I feel (like regular car review), you can't talk about the car without commenting on the culture so there will be some stuff specifically what i noticed about the trip. For those that don't like to read i will put a direct link to the gallery, but I would rather you read since I took the time to minimize the images and post. **Third**, I'll try and answer any questions about picture i can, and i by no way act as a reference on Japan, because as i said this was my vacation and life long dream of mine. Hopefully I don't break any cultural rules posting the cars (Gomenasai!), and i don't mean to offend anyone from Japan just let me know if i do, most of these are just observations i've noticed.

post,7ipd4q,,Picked up my new Audi RS3 in Viper Green this week,"Pics : 

My first Audi! Ordered in May of this year, since its an Audi Exclusive paint job it went to the back of the queue. Previous cars have been mostly Subarus (2015 WRX / 2013 BRZ / 2011 WRX), which I've always loved but this thing is on a whole different level in terms of performance and comfort.

Initial impressions: 

In comfort mode (it'll be my daily) with driver assistance its an amazing highway / traffic cruiser. This was a primary criteria when I was shopping cars - *really* sick of clutching through Bay Area traffic.

In dynamic mode it's a monster. I haven't *really* wrung it out yet as I'm only at a few hundred miles, but just wow. There's a moment of buildup (far less than my previous turbo cars) and then it just explodes. The sound is incredible - but even at full wally its pretty quiet in the cabin - I crack the sunroof when I want to hear the exhaust note. I need to find some tunnels.

The DSG is my first non-manual experience, and I won't go back for a daily driver. Surprising to me, in the first few hours I was constantly messing with the paddles, but I've found if I just leave it alone, it pretty much shifts when i'd expect it to. As an added bonus, it does a series of lovely burbling downshift blips as you coast to a stop.

Compared to my WRX (basically stock) on canyon roads, it feels much more nimble and planted, and even in dynamic mode it handles rough road surfaces much more comfortably. In comfort/auto it rides quiet and stable at freeway speed.

Virtual Cockpit is awesome, but the MMI is a bit awkward to navigate, especially when using CarPlay. Haven't tried the Android auto setup yet. 

Adaptive Cruise + Active Lane Assist + Stop and Go made my commute yesterday suck approximately 1000% less than usual. Other than the occasional pull on the stalk to get it rolling again, I went 6 miles in stop and go traffic w/o touching the pedals.

post,7ku5q6,,"Looking for some advice, considering swapping out my OEM Speed3's suspension a more comfortable setup.","So I’m thinking about doing something that seems to go against the ethos of /r/cars & MazdaSpeedForum by swapping my Speed3’s suspension bits for something more comfortable & increasing its height, and would like some advice with some questions/concerns. Post regarding this topic all seem to go in the opposite direction of what I want to achieve.


My commute is now over some of the worst maintained roads I’ve come across and include big dips, abrupt rises in pavement, raised and lowered manhole covers, crossing rail tracks multiple times a day, poorly patched potholes, etc. When I lived in Miami, I was able to deal with the stiff ride. Then I moved to Washington D.C. and the roads were bad enough that I swapped my 18-inch wheels for 16-inch wheels to give myself a little more rubber between me and the road. But now living in Baltimore, the ride quality on the OEM springs & dampers can best be described as uncouth at best. While it never crashes through to the bump stops, coming out of a steep parking lot I’ll hear the bottom of my bumper scuff against the asphalt. That being said, that’s the only complaint I have about my car. I love every other aspect of it, from the turbo, LSD, practicality, fuel economy, the feeling/feedback of the: steering, brakes, manual transmission, and yes even the clutch. So instead of selling it and buying a “more comfortable” car, I’d like to see if swapping the suspension bits will allow me to better enjoy every other aspect of my car. 

With all of those complaints in mind, I’m thinking of changing my suspension bits for something with a prioritization of comfort over sportiness. This is the setup I’m considering:

**Stock Mazda 3 springs** 

Easiest/cheapest/”most comfortable” and will give me 0.5 inches more of ground clearance.

**Koni FSD Dampers**

Decently price, and I think frequency dampening will work great to keep body roll in check while dealing well with the rail tracks & expansion joints.

post,qsm2nn,,Want to get new wheels/tires on a MYP. Looking for some guidance.,"Hi all,

As the title says, I'm about ready for a new set of tires on my Performance Model Y (got about 18k miles on the stock Pirelli's) and, since I kind of hate the stock wheels, I was going to take this opportunity to get some new ones. I'm leaning mostly toward the [Martian MW03]( (Roadster look-a-likes) but I wanted to get some guidance from anyone who has experience first.

Reasons I am looking at these, especially over others (namely T-sportline), is (1) they're lighter than the stock wheels, (2) they're a tad smaller so I'll (hopefully) get a bit better of a ride out of juicier tires and (3) they still offer a staggered wheel setup, unlike T-sportline. 

I have a few questions and concerns regarding these:

(1) Will I need to work with Tesla (or not) to change any configuration of the car itself? I heard that the calculations will change with a differently sized wheel(s), both diameter as well as width.

(2) What should I consider or what are any recommendations for new tires? I dont do any track related anything, this is mostly my daily driver and I live in the SF bay area (so snow is a non-issue, rain is barely an issue). I like to drive fast but for me, safety/traction is top priority, followed by cost-efficiency and THEN performance. (So what I'm trying to say is I DO NOT need racing tires.)

(3) I mentioned above that I wanted to keep the tires staggered, but I was told that this was highly recommended (by several folks that I trust) due to the performance motor in the back. Has anyone had any experience with non-staggered wheels/tires and is there a noticeable change in performance/safety at all? The biggest thing for me here is cost, but I think the differences are minor with a slightly wider tire, so this is mostly just satisfying my curiosity.    


Thanks anyone who takes the time. Really appreciate any advice on this. I'm a super noob when it comes to aftermarket wheels so I want to make sure I avoid any hurdles if I can.",1636754655.0,2021-11-12 23:04:15,2,1,venom80089,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qsm2nn/want_to_get_new_wheelstires_on_a_myp_looking_for/,True,0.75,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,rfgdrs,,FSD Beta 10.6.1 - The curbing,"Just had my first *brief* drive on FSD 10.6.1, it has some improvements over 10.5, however, there's some regression as well.

2017 Model X w/ AP 2.5 cameras.

It was dark out.

Unfortunately the drive did not get off to a great start.  [One of the first turns]( it had to take, it put me in a position to curb it.  This intersection gave 10.2 issues, but it got better after 10.2, with 10.5 handling it perfectly, including at night.  Today it choked in the middle of the intersection and I took control, however, there was a vehicle behind me and I didn't have enough maneuvering room to correct how bad the angle of the turn was, so I ended up running over the curb with my driver side tires, both of them.  Thankfully, I guess, it was more of a ""head on"" curbing than a side swiping one, so there's no damage to the vehicle.  **To be clear**, *I the driver* curbed it while in control of the car.  FSD Beta just put me in a position where that's what happened when I took control.  I was further to the left than I thought I was, and this intersection has worked fine for a couple versions now.  Normally when I intervene there's room for the course correction.  FSD Beta lined me up badly, but I was in control at the time of curbing.  Just to clarify a bit [this is the curb in question]( which is akin to hitting a speed bump, but it's still technically not something the vehicle has done before.

The next few intersections were just straight throughs, it handled those fine.

[This intersection here]( though there was an improvement.  Prior to 10.5 this on ramp was handled fine.  10.5 used to try to come to a complete stop at the yellow line, however, 10.6.1 no longer does this anymore, so that's a welcome improvement.

When getting off of aa highway I got to [this intersection]( where the vehicle needed to follow the red line, but followed the yellow one instead, ultimately trying to put me in the turn lane, which was not what needed to happen there.

post,orbbrm,,Sharing thoughts on first road trip in Model Y,"Just wanted to share my initial take on the first 500+ mi of a road trip we are on as we are semi new owners of an MYP. 

It’s awesome. 

Family of four, luggage for a week, Charlotte, Savannah, Legoland (updating here), south Florida, Keys, then back. 

Space: plenty. All my stuff in frunk, all my wife’s in the sub trunk. Impressed with the space as we used to travel in her Palisade. 

Range: you stop every 2hrs. This isn’t an issue for me, frankly maybe more refreshing than normal where you push it and go 3+. My one thing is I wish all the SC stops had bathrooms. Brunswick, GA is massive but it’s just a bowling alley in the parking lot and it was too early to be open. Jacksonville, Philips Hwy was the dirtiest Wawa I’ve ever seen in my entire life, ever. Was odd. Plenty of chargers yet 2 were ICE’d, one by a Wawa employee.  😂

FSD: It’s polarizing, but I am very happy with it. It has made the drive 10x more relaxing. I let it suggest lane changes for speed rather than my looking and anxiety telling me I should pass this guy… it’s been so pleasant. No issues to report either over 500mi, other than when I sped up to pass someone tailgating and got AP locked out for remaining hour. Lesson learned. 

Planning, I have been using Tesla nav without issue. I did call an audible and add a charging stop using ABRP because it wanted to leave me at Legoland with 14%. I didn’t love that. 

Overall, for those stalkers as I was, we love it and glad we ordered a second Tesla now. 😎😬",1627218797.0,2021-07-25 15:13:17,134,83,SunsOutPlumbsOut,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/orbbrm/sharing_thoughts_on_first_road_trip_in_model_y/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,lqd742,,"My 5 month, 9000 mile review of the Model Y","I ordered my Model Y sometime in July 2020. I was told I would get it ""before Q4 of 2020"":, which they were technically right. I ended up getting it on the very last day of Q3, September 30, 2020. My VIN was 50xxx. Here's my experience.

Upon pickup, the car had really big panel gaps where the rear doors met the trunk. The T Tesla logo on the trunk was very crooked, 2 of the 4 door handles were really sunken in, and there was a tiny chip in the paint on the trunk as if it had been opened and banged against some kind of ceiling. I wasn't expecting to be picky, but I mentioned all of this to the service people and they set up an appointment to fix everything. Within the first 2 weeks I took the car in and they fixed all of the problems except the paint chip. They said ""paint isn't done here, it's done at another location so you'll have to make another appointment with our affiliate to get that fixed"". The size of the paint chip wasn't big enough to where I really cared enough to make an appointment to fix it, but that's kind of shitty that I got a brand new vehicle with an imperfection and was told I needed to go to a separate body shop to get it touched up.

The car itself is a ton of fun to drive. The handling, the acceleration, the autopilot (when it works). We installed a roof rack to tie a dog cage to for a 100lb German Shepherd, but we discovered that the cage actually fit in the backseat behind the seats so we didn't even need the rack. The amount of storage space in this car is insane. We went camping in the car prior to our road trip and I bought a mattress that contoured to the shape of the vehicle with the seats down. Me, my wife, and a big ass dog were able to sleep in the car comfortably, and I was able to sleep in a t-shirt and shorts while it was 30 degrees outside because of the temperature control. Just need to make sure you're near an outlet/RV plug overnight so you don't drain your battery while you sleep.

So I can go one of two ways here, and I'm looking for anyone with experience either way to give some insight:

1) I could just install the kit with the 4 front speakers and leave the rear cable as a dead end. Any problems with doing that?

2) I could try to get the two rears installed, but I don't know much about it other than a couple of semi-related YouTube videos. Do I need more wiring to make it happen? Would it work safely? Is it worth the trouble?

I don’t really understand, what is causing it to brake when passing a semi truck and is there any settings I can change to have better luck? The trucks are not going into my lane either.

post,rj10oa,,Can you use a bank of Powerwalls to run a house entirely off grid?,"So we're looking at building our dream home.

Around 500m² inside, 4 bed, 3 bath, 3 car garage, and a 12 car shed with a mezzanine and office/mancave.

Anyways, with my combined roof area I worked out we could have in the vicinity of 40kW (probably more actually) of solar on the roof between the house and the shed with ease.

I was also going to have 4 or 5 Tesla Powerwalls in the Shed to feed the shed and the house

This will give me ~67.5kWh of power capacoty, which according to our electricity bills will last us roughly 9 days.

We discussed this with the builder who kept saying ""No, you need a meter, you need to be connected to the grid. That's just how it is. You can't just run solar. It's not possible to run your house purely off solar.""

We even approached other builders who basically said it's ""Impossible to run a whole house off batteries""

Why?

Why do I NEED to be connected to the grid?

What practical consideration is there to not just go purely off grid?

I've worked out that on our monthly power bill, plus service fees, I'd save around $1,000 a quarter, or $4,000 a year

The whole system will cost me around $70,000 or around 17.5 years to pay itself off, after that, I'm positive on the whole system.

With a $120/qr service fee, that drops me back to 20 years to pay off the system...for a connection I don't need...

I know that at the moment there are FIT's that I could benefit from, but recently with South Australia hitting [negative demand]( there's a lot of talk about charging money to export to the grid.

So seems that making money off solar is dead, or will be in the next 20 years.

So I'm not seeing any reason why in 2021 I really need a grid connection at all.",1639807698.0,2021-12-18 07:08:18,14,79,That_Car_Dude_Aus,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/rj10oa/can_you_use_a_bank_of_powerwalls_to_run_a_house/,True,0.79,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

i'm a fan of tesla i have  a resevation for the cyber truck and will probably either go model 3 or Y for the wife when its time this is by no means coming from a place of hate of the company.

 We decided it was time to transition our household to EV transport we have older fuel efficent cars but they are strting to show age and its a good time to do it instead of buying a gasser, part of this transition was going solar to offset the new power usage and to insolate us from the crazy CA electric costs and blackouts we decided on a large system 12kw and 4 powerwalls ( 12kw was the most i can fit on my roof without a huge north facing array).

the thing i can not stand is the radio silence I have gotten at several stages in the process how many times i have been handed off to another manager and the sheer lack of response to easy questions.

system has been in since the beginning of july and i still don't have PTO now some of that is out of their control but they didn't even file my paperwork until 3 weeks ago and when they did they mixed my info up with another persons and i had to point this out to get them to resend the right one. I have emailed my project manager many times and i just get ghosted outright i have called they say they are busy and will call me back and never do.

its not like i have hard to answer questions if just really sours what should be a awesome experience of going 100% energy independent, i paid almost 59K for my system and its just sitting there through the longest full sun heatwave where im paying huge power bills and huge solar bills and getting nothing out of it.

Update on my [Solar Roof install](

Roughly finished 1/8/2021. They were adjusting a panel and cracked one of the PV tiles. Replacement on monday. Next week the battery crew will come back and revert the Powerwalls to solar from grid charging. Waiting for Township inspection and electric company to change my meter to a new digital metter and PTO (permission to operate). Then I'll be generating and give another update monthly/quarterly usage etc.

Timeline:

3/10/2020: Ordered roof

3/12/2020: Submitted all pictures asked for

1/8/2021 - roughly finished, some clean up and some haul away needed.

next 2 weeks - Inspections, electrical and final turn on.

&#x200B;

As told by a few of the crews, the massive delay was probably due to COVID. State ordered shutdowns had the company rewriting policies and procedures. Workers getting sick and re-coordination also hampered the efforts. March 2020 was when they released solar roof v3 so the crew needed to be trained on how to install them.

post,1gjgc5a,,"I test drove a bunch more EVs, my thoughts on the winners and losers (Part 2)","[Given the unexpected popularity of my last post]( and my hunt for EVs taking on more of a active role given a $2500 repair bill + the prospect of more in the summer for my wife's car, I've been taking more EVs out for a spin. I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

This is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.

This is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness.

post,1fyyqdr,,"Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losers","Recently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

Because this got so popular in r/electricvehicles, I decided to repost it here, with a few corrections/additions. Any brand you don't see here I either didn't drive at the event (VW ID.4) or wasn't there (Kia EV6, Rivian, etc). I also accidentally cut off a car while editting, so you guys get an extra review for no fee 

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo

post,1f7i9mr,,My extensive 6-month Taycan GTS ownership review,"I used to own a Tesla Model 3 Performance as a daily driver and C8 Z51 as a weekend car. While both cars were great, the build quality of the Model 3 Performance as well as its “appliance like” personality started to zip a lot of joy from my day to day driving experience (as easy as it was). Likewise, while I loved the Corvette it wasn’t quite scratching the performance “itch” the way I really wanted it to, and as a weekend driver it felt like a lot of money to put into something that I was only experiencing on the weekends. I eventually had to return the Corvette to GM due to a warranty issue and used it as an opportunity to get myself into a Porsche Taycan GTS. 

For the Porsche folks the car is optioned with the following: 
-Premium Package
-Thermally noise and insulated glass 
-Adaptive Cruise Control 
-Leather interior 
-Rear Wheel Steer 
-Porsche Dynamic Chasis Control 
-Porsche Torque Vectoring 
-Sports Chrono

The car is in a pretty nice GTS color spec which you can check out here: 



I’d also like to mention that I have driven quite a few different obtainable cars. This list is the following: C5 Corvette, V6 5th Gen Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, C8 Corvette Z06, Tesla Model 3 AWD, Pre-Highland Tesla Model 3 Performance, Porsche Taycan Turbo & Taycan 4S, 997.2 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Ford Focus RS, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400 and the Lotus Elise. 

I’ll mainly be comparing the car to my experience owning a Model 3 Performance and C8. 

**Handling:** 

When I first drove a Taycan a few years ago I was absolutely blown away by the car’s handling. To me it legitimately felt sports car like, while offering an incredibly comfortable ride.

After living with the car for a few months I still have the same general opinion, but there’s a few nuances that I’ve picked up on.

post,1ezmh0y,,If Honda made an awd Civic Si would it outsell the WRX?,"I don't like the WRX. Were it not for the manual transmission and awd system I think we'd be comparing it to a Kia Forte GT. The interior sucks, there's no noise insulation, the speakers suck, you have to buy an armrest, the powertrain might as well be 20 years old,  their reliability is overstated and the styling has been getting sabotaged for years. Yet, it's one of the best selling enthusiast cars on the market. 

Subaru is able to get away with these insulting efforts because they're the only game in town.

Say you want a fun car but you're a frugal family man that lives in a place where it snows. What are your options? Family knocks out 2 seaters. Snow knocks out everything with rwd. Frugality and risk aversion knock out anything German. That leaves you with WRX, Elantra N and Civic Si. WRX costs the same amount but has AWD making it the clear winner.

The decision is made before these buyers walk into a dealership. WRX has 4 seats, 4 doors, awd and a low sticker price. It doesn't need to do or be good at anything else because it's the only car that offers that fulfills that combination of requirements. 

You see it in many other areas of the car market. Mediocre cars achieve legendary status simply because they're the only game in town. Often it's not a result of effort but rather neglect. Most of these are only here because the manufacturer abandoned the car but kept the factory running.

post,1ek64xk,,My 2-month Review of My 2024 Model 3 Performance,"Haven't seen any personal reviews of the refreshed 2024 Tesla Model 3 Performance (M3P) here and I thought I would share a somewhat detailed review, and comparing to my prior daily, a 2019 G70 3.3T AWD advanced (18-inch wheels, brembo brakes, sports suspension). 

**Background**: I got a little weary with back-to-back recalls on the G70 (starter and turbocharger oil feed pipe), and also the closure of my local Genesis/Hyundai service center. I also wanted to try something a bit more performance oriented that also had a better phone app integration than the horrible Genesis connected services that I discontinued using after the free trial period, and so I test drove a 2023 Tesla M3P back in December when I had some idea that I wanted to get into a BEV. It was quite eye opening in that the suspension was surprisingly compliant for a sports sedan with 20 inch wheels, and felt more composed than my G70 which would get unsettled easily. The instant throttle response and the planted feel during corners with the low center of gravity and quick turn-in were also impressive, making the 4000-lbs car feel much more nimble than the G70. The main drawback was that the interior of the 2023 M3P was left wanting, feeling more like an economy car than a premium car. The sound of closing the door was probably the most offensive in that regard, and I had to open and close the driver door a dozen times in total disbelief at what I was hearing.  

Subsequently, I had a chance to test drive the highland 2024 model 3 LR, which rectified all of the interior issues I had with the 2023, and it felt more premium, but I thought the suspension was too soft, and didn't like how it rolled in the corners. With those 2 test drives, I bid my time being aware of the camouflaged highland M3P being planned to be released soon, with many leaked upgrades like bucket seats, different front fascia, and adaptive suspension.

post,1eju2de,,Here's how many Tesla owners actually goes back to gas....11%. 70% gets into another Tesla.,"Great video by Alex on Autos analyzing a much better data set to give us the real picture. 




Alex's write up:
""So how many Tesla owners REALLY went back to gas? Well, thanks to one of our viewers, we got out hands on the best data possible and the answer is: Not many. In 2023, just 11% of Tesla owners that swapped into something else went back to gas. Yep, 11%, not ""more than half"" as some reporting has said. Let's dive into the data and see what Edmunds and others got wrong. 

The key thing about Edmunds' data is that it's collected from dealerships. If you didn't know, Tesla (and others) sell direct. This is critical because a whopping 70% of Tesla owners or lessees that swapped into another car, got another Tesla. 

What did the rest do? 13% swapped for another EV, 11% went back to gas, 4% opted for a mild or full hybrid, 2% got a PHEV and 1% opted for a diesel. 
So where does this data come from? It's from S&P Global Mobility, the gold standard for loyalty, sales, and conquest data. They pull all the car registration data every month from every state and crunch the numbers. (Yep, your registration data is far from private.) They match households that dispose of a car (whether that's a trade-in, sale, end of lease, gifted to someone, etc) and then see what those same households buy or lease next. 

From January 1, 2023 to February 29, 2024 (the extra 2 months ensure that replacements have been captured since sometimes it takes a while to sell a car and replace it, or replace a car and sell your old one) a total of 60,022 Teslas were ""disposed"" of in the USA. (Industry term.) 

Of those 60,000 Teslas leaving garages in America, 42,244 new Teslas took their place. What about the rest? 7,710 went back to gas, 6,385 got another EV, 2,344 opted for hybrid power, 946 gave a PHEV a whirl, and 393 opted for a diesel. 

Unlike some outlets, we need to “qualify” this data with some asterisks.

Now Chinese automakers not using Panasonic is understandable. Afterall, BYD would use their own battery and Chinese government encourages Chinese firm to use their indiginous CATL.

But no other American, Korean and none of the European automakers? What is up with that?

It is not like Panasonic has a contract that limits it to supplying Tesla only.

Panasonic's lithium-ion has both the performance (its capability don't drop like a stone in the winter like LFP) and reliability/durability. Afterall, that thing has been used since the early electric cars like Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi I-MIEV and have not caught on fire (cannot say the same for LG Chem or even BYD's own Blade)

Is it because Panasonic makes cylindrical EV batteries and many automakers are turned off by that? Because other than that reason, I do not see why automaker do not want to select them.

post,1dcebzt,,I rented a Mercedes EQS 580 4MATIC on Turo,"As the title says, I just rented a Mercedes EQS 580 on Turo, and I wanted to share my impressions.

To give a bit of background, I have owned primarily ""driver's cars"" from the 1990s. E30 BMW, Acura Integra GS-R, that kind of stuff. I appreciate cars from this era for their good blend of ownership experience, driving dynamics, and value. That said, my taste is eclectic, and I've driven a wide variety of cars old and new, ranging from a 1960 MG MGA to a 2015 Corvette Z06. I have probably rented 20 cars between Turo and DriveShare over the years. I mention this because many of my impressions are based on my experience with cars from previous decades, and in the ways those cars differ from a modern car, for better or for worse.

I was intrigued by the EQS and its reputation as one of the more luxurious and better built EVs. I've read a lot of negative opinions about the styling, but personally it's one of my favorite things about the car. I like when manufacturers step outside the box and build a product with a singular purpose - in this case aerodynamic efficiency, even if this means deviating from the usual car proportions. This type of function over form engineering used to be a Mercedes-Benz trademark, so it's neat to see it reflected here.

Prior to this, my EV experience had been with a Tesla Model 3 as passenger, and as driver in a Polestar 2.

Overall, my impression was of a car that was fun to rent, though perhaps not to own. There are many features to delight you and impress your friends - ""gimmicks"" one might call them. Things like the voice-activated sunshade and customizable light band that goes around the interior are neat at first, but I imagine the novelty wears off quickly. I question what the out of warranty ownership experience would be like owning a car with so many gadgets. Most of my gripes (such as the bunker-like feeling and small glass area) could apply to modern cars in general, and aren't an EV-specific failing.

Exhibit Q, delivered to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this morning, contains explosive new evidence of far-reaching misconduct by Twitter's executives as alleged by Twitter's Ex-Security Chief Peiter Zatko. Is this the end?","Elon Musk has dialed up his efforts to back out buying $TWTR by filing a new termination notice underpinned by “[Exhibit Q]( a document that references bombshell claims made by Twitter’s former security chief-turned-whistleblower and accuses Twitter of “far-reaching misconduct” that is likely to have “severe consequences” for its business.



Mr. Zatko alleges that:

* Twitter is in material noncompliance with both its obligations under a 2011 FTC consent decree and its general obligations under data privacy, unfair trade practice, and consumer protection laws and regulations;
* Twitter is uniquely vulnerable to systemic disruption resulting from data center failures or malicious actors, a fact which Twitter leadership (including its CEO) have ignored and sought to obfuscate;
* Twitter’s platform is built in significant part on the misappropriation and infringement of third party intellectual property; and
* Twitter acquiesced to demands made by the Indian government that its agents be hired by Twitter and given access to Twitter user information.

Basically, Elon's lawyers are contending that even if the court rejects his prior termination this NEW termination provides more than enough reason to terminate:

These allegations, if true, demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to its terms as more fully described below.

1. **Section 4.5 Permits; Compliance With Laws**\*\*.\*\* In the Merger Agreement, Twitter represented, *inter alia*, that it was in compliance with all applicable laws. That representation was apparently false when made on the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the date of the July 8 Termination Notice, and continues to be inaccurate.

post,w19mwb,,Twitter's filing in Delaware court shows Musk was actively sabotaging Twitter's business and the acquisition deal,"[The filing](  is a profile of Musk's MO: he's impulsive, petulant, and bullying; he  reneges on his word constantly; and uses his money & power to get  what he wants. Unfortunately for him, [Bret Taylor]( and Twitter's lawyers have an airtight contract which Musk (typically)  signed back in April without much thought. And despite repeated,  flagrant violations of the agreement by Musk over the next 3 months,  Twitter has abided by it. So Elon is now up shit creek without a  baguette.

Highlights:

* *""On  April 25, 2022, Musk\[\] agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in  cash, for a total of about $44 billion. That price, presented by Musk on  a take-it-or-leave-it basis in an unsolicited public offer, represented  a 38% premium over Twitter’s unaffected share price. The other terms  Musk offered and agreed to were, as he touted, “seller friendly.” There  is no financing contingency and no diligence condition. The deal is  backed by airtight debt and equity commitments. Musk has personally  committed $33.5 billion.""* (Sections 3, 4) In other words, he threw  money at Twitter, and was so confident of winning that he signed the  deal without doing any due diligence and basically guaranteeing the  financing himself.
* *""Musk’s  exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy. One of the chief reasons Musk  cited\[\] for wanting to buy Twitter was to rid it of the “\[c\]rypto spam”  he viewed as a “major blight on the user experience.” But when the  market declined and the fixed-price deal became less attractive, Musk  shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding “verification” that spam was  not a serious problem on Twitter’s platform, and claiming a burning need  to conduct “diligence” he had expressly forsworn.""* (Section 7) Due diligence is a process you do before entering into a contract not after.

If employees could own, use, or try the product they work on... they could actually understand what real owners go thru.

Other nice perks could be free enabling of software features like FSD or FUSC (maybe free charging credits per month).

And if so could you record those signals and send them to someone so a loved one could feel a experience that you felt. Now for the weird not a question but imagine if this is possible sex. You and your significant other have sex while linked and both of you feel each other.

Elon musk is worth $265 billion USD. Netflix's operating expenses are about $26b per year. Using leverage, Elon could spend as much as Netflix does to create content for a period of up to 20 years if need be. Or he could outspend everyone in the industry and take it over that way. 

Once he has control over Twitter, movies, and TV shows, he will have enough power to influence the way people perceive humanity.

 Then he will begin the Assimilation. It will begin by him offering people chips with Neuralink. 

Then we will become the hive mind together and humanity will have step-change evolved in order to outcompete machines.

post,18pz3m2,,My impression of the new Prius after a 5 days long road trip in Japan,"I find it really funny that the new Prius is one of the cars this sub was most excited about in recent times, and for very good reasons. And as someone who have *never* driven a Prius before, I jumped at the opportunity to rent one for my trip to Hiroshima.

Disclaimer: The following is just my quick impression of the Japanese market version of the car. Some of the configurations/features are probably different from the NA version.

**Exterior**: I was actually a little disappointed when I saw the one they gave me was [in black]( because it looks even more gorgeous [in a brighter color]( But overall speaking it's one of the most attractive daily drivers on the market at the moment, and one of the reasons why people were excited about the car in the first place. 

**Interior - first impression**: First thing I noticed was the terrible visibility around A-pillars. It was especially scary since Japanese city streets are much narrower and I was sharing roads with those middle school boys riding bikes as if they are in Tour de France. I was a bit nervous at every intersection because of how poor the visibility was. Someone on /r/Prius [made a post about this]( and I 100% agree. 

**Interior - cabin material**: The Prius is an economy car, and its interior...well...was designed to be *economical*. While [easy on the eye]( it had cheap plastic all over the cabin. The worst offender is Toyota chose to use piano black plastic around the *side* of the center console (where things brush against), which leads to it looking [like this]( after less than even just 1 year. 

**Interior - cabin insulation**: *Simply awful*. For those who don't know, Japanese highways have very low speed limit (50-60mph, with people driving 10-15mph over) and *perfect* pavement, yet the cabin was consistently loud enough that I had to uncomfortably raise my voice to talk to passengers in the back. 

**Interior - cabin tech**: In typical Japanese OEM fashion, the infotainment is a few years behind ind",1703437322.0,2023-12-24 18:02:02,596,185,cookingboy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/18pz3m2/my_impression_of_the_new_prius_after_a_5_days/,True,0.93,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,184ijfb,,My extensive C8 Stingray vs C8 Z06 comparison,"I am a current C8 Z51 Stingray owner who has been dying to get into a Z06 to try. I happened to find one available locally on Turo and figured spending a day in a Z06 would be a good way to spend my Thanksgiving weekend. 

The Z06 I rented is a 1LT convertible while I own a 2LT Coupe. I personally find that many Corvette owners have a hard time writing detailed accounts of the differences between the two cars so this particular post will have LOTS of detail and will be a long read. The big question I am trying to answer is if the Z06 is enough of an upgrade over the C8 Z51. To save you the long read, the answer is a resounding yes. 

Here is also a picture of the car in question: 


As a reference point I’ve also spent a considerable amount of time in the following cars: V8 Audi R8, Audi TTRS, C5 Corvette Coupe, C7 Corvette Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, Chevy Camaro V6, Lotus Elise, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400, Ford Focus RS, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifolgio, Tesla Model 3 Performance, Porsche Taycan 4S, Porsche Taycan Turbo, 718 Cayman Base, 997.2 911 Turbo, Mercedes AMG GT. 


**Power:** 

To be honest I am a little disappointed with the power in the C8 Stingray. Now don’t get me wrong the Stingray is objectively a very quick car. However I daily drive a Model 3 Performance and am just addicted to the instant torque it provides. So in comparison to the Model 3 Performance the C8 Stingray feels like its lacking a little “umph” even though the Stingray is objectively quicker than the Model 3 performance. 
The other thing I’ll note about the C8 Stingray is the engine sound is almost a little too quiet from within the cabin. On the exterior the Stingray actually sounds pretty dang good, but from within the car it just doesn’t have the volume or raw emotion that previous generations of Corvettes used to have within the cabin. 

The Z06 basically solves every issue I have with the Stingray’s power characteristics.

post,17mxgla,,Driving a ten year old supercar: Porsche 911 (991.1) Turbo,"TL;DR: Ignore the critics, this is an absolute blast to drive at any speed, and a truly involving supercar.

We live in a strange time where the mighty 911 Turbo is seen as an anachronism, almost like an old man's car. The 911 GT3 is more driver focused. The special editions like the R are more exclusive. Heck, there's even stiff competition from the likes of Chevrolet and their C8's new exotic engine location and impressive 0-60 numbers.

This entry in Turbo history has received a fair amount of criticism. Journalists have said it's too numb, too GT-like, too uninvolving at road legal speeds, and an understeery mess on a track. The electric steering, in particular, got a lot of flak. And in a world where a Tesla Model S will out-drag it - whilst hauling four passengers and all their luggage - it does raise the question of what exactly a Turbo is for.

I've been owning and driving 911s for the past ten years, but have never experienced the Turbo. With prices currently dropping into just-about-feasible territory and my 911 itch starting to scratch again, I took the opportunity to test drive a 911 (991.1) Turbo whilst having my Panamera GTS serviced.

Really, I'd like to dispel the myths about this car, and apologize for being one of the people who perpetuated some of these myths without ever test driving one.

Stepping into the car, I had no idea of what to expect. I had test driven two different 991 generation 911s: a Carrera S, which I ruled out because the electric steering felt so wrong, and a Carrera 4 GTS, which also felt too soft and GT-like to really carry the mantle of what a weekend car should be.

**THE GOOD**

* Easy to get in and out of, and a commanding view from the driver's seat.
* Never felt intimidatingly wide or low.
* I can confirm that the electric steering did not bother me for even one moment. Perhaps it's a bad match for the Carrera models, but it makes total sense in this variant. The rest of the car is so intense that you need a little bit o",1699024833.0,2023-11-03 16:20:33,115,58,cerberaspeedtwelve,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/17mxgla/driving_a_ten_year_old_supercar_porsche_911_9911/,True,0.82,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,17hklip,,Real World EV Road Trip,"Rightfully so there is a lot of debate on how effective current EVs are in anything but around-town driving. 

I thought I’d share the results of my 1000+ mile road trip in an EV to paint a real world picture to contribute to the debate.  I’m trying to keep this only about the numbers ie cost and time of charging on the roads and let the reader make their own decisions.

The trip: from Louisville KY to Madison WI and back (total trip 1085 miles) for a wedding over a long wknd in a Tesla Model Y:

1.	⁠Left Thursday evening after work, drove to hotel (Hilton chain) on the north side of Indianapolis, 125 miles.  Used their free charger to recharge to 100% while I slept.

2.	⁠Woke up Friday, drove 219 miles to a Tesla Supercharger in Peru, IL at a Hy-Vee grocery store. Charged to 92% in 40 minutes while we ate lunch, got groceries for our weekend, picked out a card for the wedding, etc. Charging cost $26.52

3.	⁠Drove the remainder of the trip to wedding location Friday afternoon. 171 miles. Plugged into a regular 120V outlet at our Airbnb to charge while the car was parked. Drove to and from various things like rehearsal dinner, sight seeing, etc.

4.	⁠Woke up Sunday morning and left with a 70% charge. Drove 125 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Rochelle IL. Charged to 80% in 25 mins while taking bathroom break, snacks, etc.  Cost $20.52

5.	⁠Drove 161 miles to Tesla Supercharger in Urbana IL. Add 54% to the battery in 20 minutes, went to the bathroom, watched part of Netflix episode. Cost $16.34

6.	⁠Drove 130 miles to Indy Supercharger, ate lunch at Jimmy John’s while charging. 25 minutes. Cost $19.50.

7.	⁠Drove the remaining 112 miles home; arrive with 25% charge. Put the car on the charger at home.

Total charging cost: $82.88. If we would have drove my wife’s Toyota (averaging 32 MPG, avg gallon of gas in the region at the time $3.70) it would have cost $127.19 in gas.

The nearly 400 hp AWD electric car is more exciting to drive than hybrid Toyota minivan.

post,16z079r,,Opinion: We should move on from the 0-60mph acceleration standard,"Cars today are so quick, that the 0-60mph tells us very little now. This is especially true due to EVs and democratized acceleration. 

I think it would be far more valuable to report **0-80 mph** times going forward. This will:

- Increase the spectrum/range of numbers thereby providing more information to consumers as the final time will be more granular
- Allow more room for improvement. Some road legal cars are practically at the physical tire limit for 0-60 time, such as Model S Plaid, Taycan, e-Tron, R1T, Air, Nevera. More will get there over time. But there is nuance because some of these are much more capable at higher speeds, and so we can expand the ""numerical gap"" between the Nevera and everything else to demonstrate how insane the Nevera really is.
- On average, Cars/traffic travel faster now than they did like 50 years ago or whenever 0-60 first started getting used. In California, people on the freeway regularly go 80+ mph (not condoning it, just fact)

0-100mph would not be as practical because nobody every actually goes that fast, and some lower end cars are likely incapable of even reaching those speeds. Also manufacturers might not want to list an official 0-100 time due 100mph definitely being an illegal speed. 80mph is still a legal speed (i.e. Texas has 85 mph freeways).

post,16ao7wx,,Just drove a new Vette,"Oh. My. God.... I've driven fast cars before (996 911 turbo, 997 GT3, R8 V8 AND V10, McLaren MP4-12C and 570, a 2016 Nissan GTR, and a Tesla Model 3 Performance) and the only thing that has been that violent off the line has been my friend's GTR or his Tesla. Letting your foot off the brake was like stepping on a landmine. Furthermore, the tightness and responsiveness was better than both of the caged Miata's that I built specifically for track duty. It didn't feel as communicative as an Elise, but it was easily as planted and responsive as the Evora S (I only drove the 2011, so I know there have been a lot of improvements in the Evora since then). Somehow, it was actually comfortable too. And the build quality!!! From a Chevy! I NEVER expected to swoon over a Corvette like this, but Chevy built a car that is truly a masterpiece. Having driven one, I now understand why some people were willing to pay so much over sticker; it feels like it's worth every bit of the sticker and then some. If any of you ever get the chance to drive one, you owe it to yourself to at least take it around the block.

Also, as somebody that has only ever been willing to buy cars with a manual transmission, I now get why having an auto might not be a deal-breaker for some. I have close to 500 hours on track and/or auto-cross, but I'm about 90% sure that this new Vette is more than I'd be able to handle with a manual. I know my skill limits, and launching has always been my weak spot. I've learned to carry momentum through corners and be as smooth as possible during brake/throttle transitions during cornering, but I honestly don't know if I could get a launch in that car without the Launch Control.

post,16adry5,,My extensive 2018 AMG-GT Review,"I took a trip up to Seattle and decided to rent a 2018 Mercedes AMG GT. To be honest, I’m not really a Mercedes fan or really a German car fan, but the AMG GT was a convertible and at the right price point so I decided to roll the dice on it. Fortunately I rolled a 6 and actually really enjoyed the car. So I figured I’d write about my experience below. 

As a reference point I’ve spent a considerable amount of time in the following cars: V8 Audi R8, Audi TTRS, C5 Corvette Coupe, C7 Corvette Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, Chevy Camaro V6 Lotus Elise, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400, Ford Focus RS, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifolgio, Tesla Model 3 Performance, Porsche Taycan 4S, Porsche Taycan Turbo, 718 Cayman Base, 997.2 911 Turbo. 

These aren’t the best photos, but here is what I rented: 



As far as I can tell this was a base AMG GT, not an AMG GT-C or AMG GT-S and the car appeared to be stock. 


**Power:** 

The power on the AMG GT is actually incredibly impressive and if I had to characterize the power delivery it would be “mid-range torque for days”. The car has a Biturbo 4.0 V8 which makes around 475 hp and similar amounts of torque. The car very much drives like a turbo charged car somewhat slow and sluggish initial response from 1,000rpm to about 2,500rpm and then after that the car just pulls incredibly hard all the way to redline. 

Now I have personally been having a lot of doubts about my future relationship with ICE cars. I daily drive a Model 3 performance and whenever I hop into an ICE car they feel incredibly sluggish off the line and lacking in torque in comparison. However the AMG GT is the first ICE car I’ve driven in a while that didn’t make me feel as if it was lacking in “punch” compared to the EV’s I’ve driven. 

What I found particularly impressive is just how well the AMG GT put its power down. Now I didn’t launch the car from a stop in my time with it, but once you get a bit of a roll going at a slow speed and start to feel th",1693886861.0,2023-09-05 06:07:41,105,25,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/16adry5/my_extensive_2018_amggt_review/,True,0.88,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

My thoughts...

* No turn signal stalk - just WTF are they thinking?!  Maybe I'm just old school.
* DO NOT like the center screen only - I want a proper dashboard, or at least a HUD.
* NVH improvements are totally on point - no one wants a noisy, bumpy riding daily EV.
* 81% of rated range - seems to fall within the typical Tesla method of determining range, ie. rated is always over
* Back screen is unnecessary - should have spent the money on a proper dash and not cost cutting by taking away tactile physical controls like stalks

All in all, the more I learn, despite them having a good EV base platform, I can't see myself buying a Tesla - its such an anti driver car, maybe that's their target audience?

post,15v0evh,,Friendly reminder that a person’s EV road trip experience can vary wildly depending on the region they live.,"I see some variation of this conversation over and over online. One person will say something like “EVs are inconvenient to me. I have to stop longer and more often than usual. It turned my typical 7 hour road trip into a 9 hour trip!” And another person will respond with something like “I just did a 7 hour road trip and the EV didn’t add ANY time. By the time I use the restroom and grab something to eat, the car is ready to go!” But here’s the rub, they BOTH can be right, even if they’re talking about the same car. The impact that an EV has on your road trip experience can vary wildly depending on where you’re travelling. Let’s take a look at two scenarios.

&#x200B;

Person A is taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the Norfolk, VA area up to the New York, NY area. Because of the traffic and speed limits, the 360 mile trip takes 6.5 hours both ways. The place he’ll be staying has a Level 2 charger where he can charge overnight. According to ABRP, he can do the entire trip with just one \~30 minute stop on the way there and one \~30 minute stop on the way back. He normally makes a 30 minute stop to eat lunch when using his gas car anyway, so the Model Y doesn’t add any time to his trip. His typical 14 hour round trip still takes 14 hours. 

&#x200B;

Person B is also taking a round trip in a Model Y LR from his home in the San Antonio, TX area out to El Paso, TX area. Since he can comfortably drive 85 mph for the entire 550 mile trip, it usually takes him around 7 hours each way including stops, meaning his typical round trip is also 14 hours. (Note: This is another area that causes confusion with people in different regions. The speed limit during most of the drive is 80 mph with a few areas at 75 mph. 85 mph is the actual flow of traffic and not some dangerously high speed that you may be picturing if you’re used to 65 mph highways.) The place he’ll be staying does not have EV charging, so he’ll be relying on Superchargers for all his juice.

post,15qrfjt,,My 2 weeks ownership review of the BMW i4 eDrive35,"In my [previous post]( I discussed the decision making process that led to me leasing a BMW i4 eDrive35 as the replacement for my Model 3 Performance being my daily driver. So now I've officially owned the car for 2 weeks, here is what I think of it so far.

*Disclaimer*: This entire ""review"" is mostly based on my *personal* preferences and I evaluate the pros/cons based how it fits my current needs. Different people like different things so your milage may vary (pun intended).

**Exterior**: It's not the prettiest car on the road, but I do like how it looks for the side and the rear and even the front has grown on me a bit to no longer be offensive. I thought the [silver color]( was boring at first but I now really like it since it looks quite sleek and my Porsche is already [flashy enough]( The build quality is excellent and feels much more premium than the F30 BMW 335i I owned. Paint quality is fantastic and is in a different class than my old Model 3. Also I love silly details like the [light carpet]( 

**Powertrain - Performance**: First of all, this car is *a lot* slower than my Model 3. Now with that out of the way, just how slow is the slowest EV BMW sells at the moment? The answer is it's actually quite decent. BMW's official numbers are 282hp/295lb-ft/5.8s 0-60. In typical BMW fashion I suspect all those numbers are generously underrated and the car feels properly fast at speed up to 50mph. Launching at 0mph actually doesn't feel as fast as stomping the throttle at 30mph (which is fast enough to scare unsuspected passengers). My guess is it's related to RWD/traction control. At 50-80mph it's about as quick as an ICE BMW 330i/430i, but feels quicker due to the instant throttle response and silky sooth power delivery. At 80mph+ it's no longer quick and merely becomes *adequate*. All in all it won't impress anyone who's owned faster EVs but it's still faster than most things on the road, especially given how effortless and responsive it is.

post,155yyr6,,After many years of waiting my c8 Z06 finally arrived!,"Obligatory pictures here ->  [ (I am not a good photographer)

&#x200B;

I ordered this car back in 2019 when I first saw the announcement about the base c8. I knew that one day the big daddy version would come in and I was hopefully I would be in a position to purchase one when that time finally came around. I've had it about a month so far and put close to 1k miles on it.

4 years and 12+ cars later the day finally rolled around and I was thankfully financially capable of signing the paperwork and taking home this dream car. In the last few years waiting I've owned: Ap2 S2000, E90 M3, GTR with 750+ HP, 991.1 911S, 718 cayman, 2x c8's, model 3P(current), Cayenne(current), A7, gen 2 and gen 3 raptor. So I've been blessed to drive some cool cars and hopefully that gives some perspective on my experience.

I can without a doubt say this is the most exciting car I've ever driven. It has the pull of the GTR with the handling characteristics of the cayman. The ride is smooth in just about any settings and the tranmission is extremely quick. It attracts attention but not at the same level of my GTR (which was bright yellow).

The engine in this car is the true stand out and I will usually rev it out on every single pull just to hear that sweet music. I would put it on a similar level of a v12 Lamborghini, it's that good. On the lower end of the rpm it sounds more American but as you rev higher it sounds extremely exotic. I don't understand why anyone would put an aftermarket exhaust because in track it is extremely loud and in weather mode you can cruise into the neighborhood undetected.

Steering feel is extremely precise and nicely weighted but does lack some of the feedback I had in my e90 m3. 

My only gripe so far is the poor gas mileage and small fuel tank, which means I only get about 180 miles on a full tank. I am filling up almost every week.

Happy to answer any questions and will look to get more pics uploaded later today!

post,151nudn,,My Extensive Lotus Elise Ownership Experience,"About a year ago I purchased one of my dream cars, a 2005 Chrome Orange Lotus Elise. I had rented both a Lotus Evora and Lotus Elise a couple of years ago, and totally caught the Lotus bug. I’d love to write about my purchasing experience as well as elaborate on various aspects about the car that I don’t think quite get mentioned enough when people talk about the Elise. 

I regretfully did sell the Elise for a C8 Corvette since my Dad is handicapped and couldn’t fit in the Elise but could fit in the Vette. He has had some more recent health scares so I felt it was important to get a car that I could spend more time with him in while I could. 

I’d also like to mention that I have driven quite a few cars that are somewhat attainable, that list includes the following: C5 Corvette, V6 Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Tesla Model 3 AWD, Tesla Model 3 Performance, Porsche Taycan Turbo & Taycan 4S, 992 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, Alfa Romeo 4C, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400 and the Lotus Elise. 

**Buying Experience** 

I looked for an Elise for about (18) months. My main criteria was finding an Elise that was as cheap as possible, with a clean title, and not blatantly molested (either mechanically or aesthetically). 

The price for an Elise has pretty much sky rocketed since the pandemic hit. The cars could be had all day everyday for around $30-35K and by the time I started looking seriously most were sitting at $45K+. This created a pretty big dilemma for me. An Elise in the $30K range was a total no brainer. At $45K it became much harder to justify. Since Elises are so old, I knew no matter how good of a car I bought, I’d have to sink money into it at some point fixing something. At $30K I could afford to set aside some money to do those things, at $45K that money was going into my monthly payment. 

I also had the intellectual dilemma of “do I try to out wait the car bubble?” As mentioned, prior to the pandemic the El",1689557237.0,2023-07-17 03:27:17,527,113,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/151nudn/my_extensive_lotus_elise_ownership_experience/,True,0.96,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,14pweqh,,Why are so many EV interiors so god damn FUGLY?,"Seriously! 

It's like every designer has no idea what to do once the requirement of having an RPM gauge was removed. Every interior seems to try to copy Tesla's minimalism (which, while visually interesting, does not need to be everywhere) because a car has to ""look electric"". Want knobs? Fuck you. Want buttons? Chew glass. Just screens, infinite screens.  

I want my next car to be electric, but I can't stand any of these interiors. I know I'm being dramatic, but still. That fucking monitor in the Model S has been a disaster for the automotive industry. Guess my poor G35 is going to be forced to live forever.

post,141wmd7,,"Opinion: I've owned a Plaid for 6 months now, it's the best and worst car I've ever owned","In the months of my ownership I've nearly come full circle in what I want from a car and, the Model S Plaid has taught me some (expensive) life lessons;

Once you reach the peak of the mountain, there is no where to go.

Sometimes the chase is more of a thrill than the ride. (my first car was a 1.8L Mazda Protege)

The Plaid is quick to the point of being indescribable and, equally disappointing. Disappointing in that there can be no fun had in a car that reaches 130 mph from 70 in less than 3 seconds. To be clear, the first couple of months is SHOCKINGLY fun, when that wears off and you acclimate to that kind of speed; it becomes normalized. A toe tap and you're doing 90. You find yourself turning it down so that you don't have to make millimeter adjustments in the volt pedal so you're not doing 10 over accidentally.  

None of these things are new or interesting but, for my two cents all I can think of as I reflect on owning what can only be described as this, *machine of speed*  is a Honda Civic SI, maybe a Golf R.I won't bore anyone here with a lethargic post about how the Plaid is in another league, as it would be a fruitless endeavor no doubt evidenced by the lack of shenanigans on the road to those that merely see the badge.

If this is the pinnacle, then it brings both equal admiration and, distain that is well deserved for both aspects and, I just don't know if I can really enjoy a car for more than 1.5-2 seconds at a time flooring it.

post,1404oi3,,My C8 Corvette & Tesla Model 3 Performance vs. Porsche Taycan 4S Shootout,"**Intro:** 

I test drove a Taycan Turbo a couple of years ago and absolutely fell in love with the car. It had this amazing blend of performance and technology that really appealed to me, but unfortunately was very much out of my price range. 

I was fortunate enough to get some lucky rolls of the dice financially and was able to add a C8 Corvette to my garage while still maintaining a Model 3 Performance as a daily driver. I had long thought that this was the ultimate price performance power combo. The Model 3 Performance punches way above its weight class for the price. While the C8 provides the supercar driving experience for a fraction of the money. Though the power combo is a match that I am very lucky to have in my garage, all isn’t perfect. I spend the vast majority of my time in my Tesla and there are a lot of instances where it doesn’t quite feel special or unique enough nowadays. Likewise, I hate buying gas for my C8, and despite its overall driving prowess it does actually feel a little slow compared to my Model 3 due to its lack of instantaneous torque that I’ve grown accustomed to. I also feel like I have a lot of money being spent on a C8 that I only get to experience on the weekends so have been curious if there’s a way to experience a bit more of that “specialness” day to day. 

I then looked at some used Porsche Taycans randomly one day and noticed that used 4S models and used Turbo models were well below the combined price of both of my Tesla and Corvette. So for the past few weeks I became obsessed with the question of whether a single Taycan could give me the best of both my Model 3 and Corvette in a package that was ultimately cheaper than the combined cost of both cars. 

I decided to rent a modestly specced Taycan 4S on turo and arrange for an unscientific shoot out amongst all three cars. 

**About the cars:**

post,13nxvrt,,Covering Frame Rust - Tips to keep it from getting worse,"I recently bought a used vehicle from Canada that apparently was washed only from the “top down”, so the body and paint looks great, but the frame and subframe does have some good rust beyond just surface rust. 

It’s a 2020 model year so it’s not too advanced yet, but looking ahead several years down the road, I don’t want to let it get worse and become a structural issue. 

What I would like to do is thoroughly clean the underside to get rid of any leftover salt brine left in any crevices, and then coat it with some sort of rust reformer or preventative to keep it from getting worse.

My question is looking for tips on what coating would work best to keep the rust from advancing further. 

I’m aware typical rubberized undercoating is the worst thing to apply, as it essentially traps moisture against the metal and causes rust to  accelerate. I’ve heard of fluid film wool wax, which is supposed to provide a moisture displacing coating that will stop of chemical process of iron converting to rust, but I’m curious if anyone has any real-world results to back their claims up. 


It’s worth mentioning the vehicle is now in the southern US and will seldomly if ever be exposed to salt again in the future. Please no suggestions for “pull the body and sandblast the entire frame back to metal”, as I don’t have the time to money for that.

post,13gwbw1,,My Tesla Plaid Experience,"So today was the big day. I booked a 1 day rental for a Tesla Plaid on Turo about a month ago. I had to drive to Jersey to pick it up (3 states away). Lot of traffic and bullshit to contend with but totally worth it in the end. 

My take away is that it it's an incredible car, especially given the price point. 

I don't hate the yoke, but I don't love it either.

Visibility blows, in spite of all the cameras. A good old fashioned convex mirror would do wonders, especially when trying to parallel park

Biggest grievance was the shifter. It makes so little sense. Slide forward to shift to drive, double tap to park, and worst of all, I can't tell whether the car is ""Off"" or not 

I loved the dynamic driving modes. Comfort mode does a great job soaking up bumps in the road 

And Plaid mode is fucking exhilarating. Blistering fast with shit loads of torque. I do find it was way more enjoyable to roll into the throttle than to just plant your foot. Also, flying around corners is way more fun than driving in a straight line 

My brother tagged along for the ride. He thinks I'm crazy for not being blown away by the performance. It's fast, no doubt. But I'm afraid I've become numb to it. I've ridden in some seriously fast cars, owned a tuned and modified Focus ST for 5 years, drove a Model S Performance earlier this year. 

For each car that I rent/own, I keep expecting to relive the pinned-to-your-seat acceleration I experienced when I got a ride in a fast car for the first time (highly modified 1990 Eclipse GSX).

post,11zilc7,,EV’s represented 5% of total new car sales in 2022.,"So I just read this in a news article. And it got me thinking. Why are car companies replacing entire fleets with EV’s when they only represent 5% of new car sales? 

I did own a Tesla, they are good cars, and I understand the appeal for them as a daily driver. But there are a ton of issues with them that make me confused on why companies are abandoning petrol cars so quickly. 

The actual range for EV’s are not that great. Between high speeds on the highways, and underperformance in the cold. I don’t think people realize how much under the rated range it comes in at. I was getting 180 miles range on the highway with my model 3. (I do drive fast)

The obvious other things that have been beat to death, but important nonetheless. Infracture, apartment charging, cost of the car itself. Rising electricity costs will be interesting as well. 

One other thing people don’t realize, is the downgrade in performance the cars have as the battery depletes.

post,10d1egl,,I Drove All The Way From Boston To Montreal Just To Check Out And Do A Thorough Tour On The Vinfast VF 8,"Full review on YouTube coming soon:

Since I heard that there is a Vinfast store in Montreal, I decided to drive all the way from Boston to Montreal QC just to check out the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 9. Obviously, Vinfast has seen a lot of controversy both on YouTube as well as Reddit with many accusing it of vapourware and many thinking that it is DOA (dead on arrival), but the Vinfast showroom has seen a lot of consumer interest not only amongst Vietnamese people, but I have also met one Laotian family, one Cambodian family, as well as many people from different races and ethnicites. Since the full tour and review on YouTube would talk about the specs, I am only going to examine the pros and cons of this car to see if Vinfast even has a chance in the US market given the fact that Tesla dropped the price of the Model Y to about 53k for the Long Range Edition.

**Positive aspects of Vinfast:**

* The Vinfast VF 8 Plus does have a lot of safety features such as traffic jam assist, auto parking, and smart summon (debatable if these safety features really work or they are just vapourware) as well as a big 15.6 inch infotainment system with a browser, voice recognition, navigation, as well as OTA updates. The fully equipped VF 8 plus even comes with a power liftgate (VF 8 Eco however has a manual liftgate), a panoramic sunroof, vegan leather, power seats, an electronic gear shifter/parking brake, as well as a frunk, just like the Tesla Model Y. It even has a heads up display and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, something which Tesla doesn't have on their cars, albeit CP/AA doesn't work on the Pre-production models.
* Both have surprisingly decent styling. Even though the Vinfast VF 8 and VF 6 would look more like a traditional car like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Mazda CX-50, Nissan Rogue, Mercedes Benz GLC, BMW X3, etc, especially with the traditional door handles, the Vinfast VF 9 and VF 7 have a more radical and futuristic design with the electronic door handles, kind of like ",1673832856.0,2023-01-16 02:34:16,91,26,MussleGeeYem,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/10d1egl/i_drove_all_the_way_from_boston_to_montreal_just/,True,0.81,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Thoughts on Hyundai aside, this is a good preview of some changes on the horizon for enthusiast EV's. 

With simulated shifts and rev limiter plus internal and external speakers, Larry Chen feels it improves on the driver experience compared to existing EV's like the Model 3. 

&nbsp;

Personal opinion: EV's will never quite match the lively, mechanical feel of an ICE car. I have to admit, though - as time goes on, ICE-only daily drivers will make less and less sense from a reliability, emissions, and total cost of ownership standpoint.

One big benefit to all the electronics in modern cars is drive modes (the more customizable, the better). 

With the right combination of internal and external speakers, sound modes, simulated shifts, physical paddles or ""shifter"", and rev limiter I can see EV's becoming a lot more engaging and enjoyable to drive. All of that and they could be turned back to a normal, quiet EV mode at the push of a button for commuting.

post,17ht82e,,Why are people fixated on road trips in EVs,"I have seen multiple times argument about spending 1-2 additional hours on a road trips being a big inconvenience and sole reason for not getting an EV. That's just one variable though and not even a significant one IMO. Just using my scenario as an example, which is not a typical situation for everyone but my point is, evaluate your own situation using all the variables than fixating on just one or two. 

I own a gas car myself, it's 2019 Kia stinger, I get about 18mpg (I like the acceleration), on average I put 16 gallons when I go to gas station and I put approximately 12k miles a year. It's well equipped GT2 model and does 0-60 in 4.7 seconds.

Time: So basically I take about 42 trips per year to gas station, detour, payment and fill up takes about 10 minutes. That's 7 hours per year for me. Charging at home would be close to 0. I take once a year road trip that may add say 2 hours. 

Cost to purchase: I paid about 44k for it. Model 3 long range that does 0-60 in 4.2 sec would have been 47k (both including taxes by my state and I do not qualify for 7500 rebate, or else it would have been 39.5k). 

Cost per mile: Total cost to me is about 2.5-3k a year in gas. While charging model 3 long range solely at home would have cost me less than 400.

Road trip: If detour/added time is bad, I would rent a gas car. 

Disclaimer 
1. Not saying EV is for everyone and for every situation, I have manual BRZ as a track which would never be replaced 
2. I am not saying my example scenario is typical or represents even a majority, actually I am pretty sure most would have much more efficient gas car, that was probably cheaper to buy in first place
3. I don't own a home yet, so I can't really charge at home, pretty much why I haven't bought one, and even if I did it would be one of 3 cars for me while other 2 would be gas
4.

post,16toqei,,"Anybody here who's curious about EVs and doesn't know much about them? ""No Stupid Questions"" thread. I'll answer to the best of my ability. (This thread might go over like lead in a pond, but YOLO)","T4R. Never was a car guy, but for some reason I'm obsessed with EVs. And not from the 'green' perspective, either--I love the tech, the drive feel, and the lack of noise (which I know will be a huge put-off for most).

I've been fully EV for about six months now. Took delivery of our 2023 Tesla Model 3 in December; and loved it so much I traded in our 2013 Mazda 3 hatchback for a 2016 Nissan Leaf SV not much long after (June). No ragrets.

The Model 3 has been great (for me) so far. Zero issues. It's one of the LFP ones. [Recently did a road trip from Toronto to Halifax]( and back again, totalling \~3500 km.

Our other car, the 2016 Leaf, kinda is the embodiment of all the negative talking points you hear about, since it's an older EV: It uses an outdated & slower charging standard, has a small battery, and has significant battery degradation (29%) since Nissan decided, in their infinite wisdom, to not give the Leaf a coolant loop for the batteries. (Heat is the biggest killer for EV batteries). But the Leaf is our backup car for local puttering around or as our second car if both me & the wife need a car for separate things.

I can't even charge at home (old-ass apartment building). I charge the Tesla at the nearby Supercharger, and charge the Leaf across the road at the civic center where they have some slow chargers.

I know EVs aren't for everybody, but AMA if you're curious and don't have much experience/knowledge with them",1695831171.0,2023-09-27 18:12:51,116,303,MrGruntsworthy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/16toqei/anybody_here_whos_curious_about_evs_and_doesnt/,True,0.7,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,16fi3qv,,"After two years of waiting, I got my Z06. Here are my initial thoughts.","Tl;dr - I love it. **If it had a different interior, you'd swear while driving that it was made by an exotic manufacturer.** It is an improvement over the Stingray in every way and it's my favorite car that I've ever driven.

-----

Apologies in advance. I usually don't review things too much, but seeing as the Z06 is still relatively new, I figured I'd share some early thoughts. I've only got about 200 miles on it so far, so still in the engine break in period.

After putting down my deposit about two years ago and getting lucky to receive an ""early"" allocation at one of the big Corvette dealers, I finally received my Z06 a couple days ago.

You can probably already tell by my flair, but I also currently own a C8 Stingray. I've also recently (last two years or so) owned a 981 Cayman GTS, a Tesla Model 3, and a Mercedes C43 AMG. Also in the last couple years, I've been able to have quite a bit of seat time, either through rentals or friends, in an AMG GT, Huracan, 458, R8, Supra, and DB11. All that context to say that I like driving in general and there isn't one particular experience that I look for. I can enjoy small sports cars, luxury cars, old JDM cars, and whatever else.

***First impressions***

**The looks**

I mean, it's basically the same as the Stingray except for...

* It's a bit wider
* It has an updated front fascia
* The side boomerang is now a wishbone
* The exhaust is in the center of the rear rather than the corners

At this point, people have largely developed their own opinions on how the car looks. It isn't for everyone (with some people getting weirdly aggressive about how much they don't like it), but I really enjoy it. The Z06's changes give it better proportions, IMO, and fix some of the issues with the rear end on the Stingray.

**The interior**

...is the same as the Stingray. However, the cabin is much louder. The engineers programmed the exhaust to reflect a lot of noise back into the cabin.

post,161j3gf,,I'm delighting in the design differences between two cars made by the same manufacturer - a Cadillac CTS and XT5.,"Soon, I'm going to replace the struts and shocks in my car and my spouse's car - my 2018 Cadillac CTS, and her 2018 XT5. While ordering parts, I made a discovery. For the CTS, there are two different parts for the rear shock absorbers - one for left, one for right. Each top mount on each shock has three bolt holes for attaching the shock to the chassis - one facing forward, two facing rearward. This configuration is mirrored on both sides, which is why two different part numbers are needed. ([5601048]( and [5601049]( for the curious)

That's pretty standard stuff - nothing out of the ordinary there. 

Meanwhile, on the XT5, there's only one part number for the rear ([84896799]( for the curious). Instead of mirroring the car down the centerline, the locations of the bolt holes are flipped between the two sides, so only a single part number is needed. 

There's not much of a point to this post - I just thought this observation was neat. I can't help but wonder why both vehicles weren't designed identically in this regard. The 3rd gen CTS's first model year was 2016, while the XT5's was 2017; from a consumer's standpoint, the two vehicles have a bit in common, even in spite of their obvious differences. Ya know, one's a RWD 4-door Camaro, the other's a FWD family crossover, but they both have the same 3.6L engine and share a fair bit of software. I can't help but wonder what internal processes at GM took place that lead to this design difference between the cars. 

Anyway, what are some quirky design differences you've seen between some other cars?",1693017978.0,2023-08-26 04:46:18,28,12,ads1031,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/161j3gf/im_delighting_in_the_design_differences_between/,True,0.86,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,15f6951,,"After a bunch of shopping around, I just leased a BMW i4 e35 to replace my Tesla as my new daily","I've been in the fortunate position to have a weekend fun car + daily 2 car garage for a while. For a daily Tesla Model 3 for 4 years until I sold it last summer for almost how much I paid for it initially, right before I moved to another country.

Now I'm back in the States and I need another daily again. No, despite what you hear the 718 GTS is a terrible daily driver, especially a manual one in this atrocious Pacific Northwest traffic. After 2 weeks my left calf is now visibly larger than my right one, thanks to the heavy clutch. And getting around 16 mpg when gas price is $6/gallon doesn't feel good either.

The following are the cars I considered and drove:

**Tesla Model 3**: Best cost/performance EV powertrain in the business. A Model 3 Performance is 15% cheaper than a Kia EV6 GT and 30% cheaper than a BMW i4 M50, while having longer range and the Tesla charger network. But I want something different this time around. I wanted something with a *premium* interior and good noise insulation, two things that I disliked the most about the Model 3. 

**Kia EV6**: Great packaging and good platform. Looks good from the outside, a ton of space inside, decent range and very good value. The interior material/build quality feels cheap. However the deal breaker was the seats. Something was protruding weirdly in the back against my lower spine and I couldn't get comfortable no matter what. Tried lumbar adjustment, different car, etc, didn't go away. Can't buy a car that I don't feel comfortable sitting in.

**Hyundai Ioniq 5**: Great car. Slightly better than the Kia EV6 in many ways and feels more premium. However I had the *exact* issue with the seats (probably same source). No go for me personally, but I highly recommend it.

**Genesis GV60**: Now this was a shockingly good car. I liked the polarizing exterior design and the interior was drop dead gorgeous, with details and materials that punch far above its segment.

&#x200B;

1. LUCID never intended to be a successful car company, but rather they intended to be an engineering firm and their cars are just being used to showcase their technology and gain publicity.   
The Air came out as a large luxury sedan. That is the most overcrowded EV segment, but it shows that LUCID is prioritizing its engineering over all else. Ever decision about the car was made from an engineering standpoint. The body is an ugly sedan, because that's the most aerodynamic shape. Its a luxury car to help hide the expensive costs of the battery and other electric drive train components. All of the drive-train components are some of, if not the best components in any electric vehicle. There are videos on youtube that LUCID posts that go into extensive details of why they are so efficient. LUCID has one single video on design posted. Its under a minute long and basically says that it was designed by the engineering team for efficiency.  
We're already seeing them begin to do engineering work for other companies like Aston Martin and this trend will only continue to grow.
2. Several traditional car companies are pricing themselves out of relevancy and leaving a huge gap in the market for startups and Chinese car companies to come in and take over. People can't buy exactly what they want. They have to select from the choices that they're given. As most car companies have raised their prices significantly in the last couple of years, consumers generally still have to pick from any of the now expensive cars. There is now a huge hole in the lower end of the new car marketplace for someone to come in and make a killing with a half-decent offering.

post,12z6w5f,,Why isn't more attention placed upon seat cushion height for comfort?,"Look, I'm a reasonably tall person. 5' 11"". Thing is, all that height is in my legs, so I don't care so much about backseat headroom. Even backseat legroom isn't that big of a deal to me. The one thing though that I'm noticing with modern cars, *especially* EVs, is shallow floors are really annoying. The height of the base of the seat cushion from the floor isn't enough to be comfortable in something like a Tesla Model 3. [Here's a diagram to explain what I mean.]( Honestly, a shallow seat where my thighs can't rest on the cushion is more annoying than minimal legroom, yet absolutely nobody is talking about something that I feel should be a pretty important metric for passenger comfort. Why is this? Why is nobody measuring this sort of thing? It's a pretty big shortcoming of the F-150 Lightning that I haven't seen anyone mention, the back seats are way more annoying to sit in because they raised the floor height in this manner to fit more battery in.


Edit: Let me clarify that this complaint is mostly about the rear seats. In the front seat you can stretch out your legs into the pedal box and what I'm describing is no big deal. I'm mostly annoyed with how 99% of modern EVs have uncomfortable backseats because the floor space is eaten up by the battery. And this doesn't mean I want a taller car, I don't like towering over traffic.

post,119jpjo,,"The (lack of) efficiency of ""eFuels"" - 76 kWh of electricity to get a gallon of fuel","While eFuels come up often, I rarely see their energy costs mentioned in articles. It's often said that they're expensive, but that's usually met with ""but it'll get cheaper when it scales up"".

Maybe, but probably not significantly.

Making efuels is basically:

* Capture carbon from air - carbon capture is so inefficient that if you ran with it an efficient gas/oil power plant, you'd still be putting more CO2 into air.

source:  

> “Even if you have 100 percent capture from the capture equipment, it is still worse, from a social cost perspective, than replacing a coal or gas plant with a wind farm because carbon capture never reduces air pollution and always has a capture equipment cost. Wind replacing fossil fuels always reduces air pollution and never has a capture equipment cost.”

* Electrolyze water to get hydrogen - electrolysis is typically 75-85% efficient, but there are solutions on the horizon to increase the efficiency



* Combine carbon and hydrogen into hydrocarbons - no idea on energy costs of those reactions

* Burn them in your internal combustion engine - which are inherently inefficient

when you multiply up all those efficiencies, you get 20 kWh per liter of fuel, or 76 kWh per gallon.

> Altogether, it takes about 20 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy to produce a liter of eFuel, which contains about 9 kWh of energy.

source: 

Tesla Model 3 can cover 378 miles on 76 kWh. Adjusting for charging efficiency (90% for Level 2 charging -  ) - we get 340 miles to the gallon of eFuel. 

eFuels seem to be a solution destined for keeping old, high-value cars running (like Porsches).

Due to its high cost, it's unlikely to be useful for old cheap cars - it'd be better to just replace them with non-ICE technology.

It just seems like it'd be more efficient to skip that whole song and dance of carbon capture and synthesizing and burning fuel, and just use the hydrogen in fuel cells.

But I'm excited about being able to run a kart and be carbon neutral.",1677113825.0,2023-02-23 01:57:05,89,67,gumol,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/119jpjo/the_lack_of_efficiency_of_efuels_76_kwh_of/,True,0.85,2023,tesla,search,False,False,0,

As someone who hates dealerships and wants something ""greener"" the car has definitely appealed to me.

These are just my thoughts, I figured others might be interested in reading it from someone who has a lot of experience with working on cars and maintaining them.

Things to know about me:

* I have build a 400whp speed3, full bolt-ons, suspension work all done by me. I outsourced machining of the motor and assembly of the shortblock

* Owned ford probe, mustang, 3 series, santa fe, mazda 6, speed3

* Drove many cars, porsche macan, s4, lexus isf, gs, m3, m5, and many others when I worked at the dealer

*  I have professionally painted cars for a few years and did some disassembly and assembly

* I did paint correction for a year or two

* Did some racing in cars and motorcycles

I rented the Tesla from hertz, 2022 Model Y Dual Motor LR.

The good:

* I enjoy the tech, I did not connect my phone to my rental so that limited my ability to test all the connectivity features

* This thing IS FAST and drama-less, I like that it is super under the radar, it takes off from a stop like a missile. It is a very ""NEW"" and exciting experience. It is a pretty good bang for the buck for a fast family hauler at the current price point.

* Everyone seems to love the thing and are wowed by the acceleration and the center screen

* Seats were extremely comfortable

* The interior ""appeared"" luxurious to me, upper door panels are soft, there is fake leather usage on doors, soft upper dash, nice seats, NOT Macan nice obviously

* Steering wheel felt good and the weight of it could be adjusted

Also, who, if any, outside of Vietnam would buy the Vinfast VF 8 over the Tesla Model Y? Would Vinfast be competitive if they halved the prices to 30k and 40k respectively for the VF8 and VF9 to steal market share from cars like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CR-V, Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, etc., or they would fail regardless?

post,108x3e8,,1-Year Ownership Review: 2022 Corvette C8 (And Final),"[9-Month Review](

[90-Day Review](


[Recent Pics](


Hello Again All! 

I wanted to come back and provide an update on my ownership experience with my 2022 Corvette. So, technically speaking, this is a 14 1/2 month review, but I've had a long holiday season and honestly haven't got to drive it as much as I would like but I've been looking forward to the opportunity to sit down and touch on a few points from my last posts (above). 

Current Mileage: 16,663 

Maintenance/Repairs: Second service at 14,500 for a total cost of $143. Included oil change, infotainment firmware update, and an air filter replacement. I also had them check a small ""whirring"" sound the car gets at between 55-57 mph in cruise control I noticed at 9k but It was a non-issue GM kind of thing and much less annoying than the LT ""tick"" I've had in past cars. 

Current Thoughts: 

Over the past few months, my vette has essentially been my go-to roadtrip car. Despite the fact I really only have the opportunity to drive it maybe two days a week currently, any time I am making a weekend trip, making a long drive, grabbing groceries, or going on a date night and the weather is half-decent it's my go-to car. So, the few times I do pull it out, I get a lot of time with it and every time I drive it is just as exciting as the day I left the dealership with it.

One of the things I've come to appreciate about it the most, is how incredibly comfortable I am with the car and how confident I feel as if I'm ""one"" with the car in a way because it's so simple to drive. In my last post, I referenced to being more comfortable daily driving this than I am my Model 3, and that's 100% the case (except for the recent ice storm we got in Nashville and that was simply a RWD thing). Of the 16+ cars I've owned and probably 50+ different rental cars I've driven for my job there is not a single car I've felt as ""at home"" in as this.

This is the article I am referencing: 

I find this practice to be reprehensible and unethical yet it is accepted and no one seems to be bothered by it.  This practice needs to stop now.

What if:
1.) You buy a 2 TB hard drive but only have access to 1.5TB and have to pay an extra $10 to get access to the whole hard drive.

2.) My car has a 21 gallon tank.  What if they decided to put a spacer in it to limit how much gas I can put in to like 18 gallons.  If I pay them $2000 they will remove the spacer.

3.) You can get the iPhone X for $250 less but you only have 75% of your screen available.

Not much info about their tech, but they're using a thin lithium metal anode, which dispenses with much of the weight and volume of Li-ion. 

This will drive a lot of new technologies just as Li-ion advances drove the proliferation of quadcopters, smart phones, and electric cars. By comparison Tesla's most recent ""30% more dense"" battery has 130 Wh/kg. Imagine replacing your batteries and getting nearly 3.5 times more range.

post,6pxit8,,"/r/technology - it's vitally important that we talk about MQA, a new, proprietary audio format","""MQ-What‽"", I can hear you say?   Well, MQA is short for [Master Quality Authenticated]( - a relatively new audio codec spearheaded by Meridian Audio, a British manufacturer of audio equipment.

""Explain?"". [John Siau of Benchmark Media Systems, Inc has explained it well]( - I'll try to provide a short summary, MQA is a proprietary audio format that seeks to embed high-resolution audio in a (24-bit, 44.1 kHz) FLAC container, where it splits the original signal into two parts: A compatible lossless portion that occupies the 13 to 15 most significant bits, along with an 8 to 11 bits proprietary lossy container that ""unfolds"" to, so you can end up with a 17-bit, 96 kHz file.  During this process, it also instructs the converter on how to apply reconstruction filters during the conversion process to change how high-frequency transients behave.

""B...but, isn't that a _good_ thing?"".  No.  There is _zero_ evidence that audio with a higher resolution than 16/44.1 kHz (CD quality) is of any benefit.  [This study by Meyer and Moran]( inserted a 16/44.1 analog-to-digital-to-analog loop in a high quality setup, and tested it on a large number of users.  Until music was being played so loud that the 16-bit converter's noise floor exceeded the natural noise floor of the listening space, users were unable to tell whether the loop was inserted into the playback chain.  MQA, Ltd. and Meridian has also come up with an alarming lack of robust evidence of MQA being an audible benefit in controlled blind experiments.

""Ok, so it isn't of any benefit, but it at least does no harm?"".  Well, this is not correct either.  Remember where I wrote that it splits the audio signal into two parts: A compatible part that occupies the 13-15 loudest bits of your music, and a proprietary part that occupies the lower 8-11?    This means that if you try to play MQA audio in an incompatible environment, you are left with 1-3 bits of semi-correlated pseudo-random noise.  The lowest three bits in a 16-bi",1501176588.0,2017-07-27 19:29:48,100,61,Arve,technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pxit8/rtechnology_its_vitally_important_that_we_talk/,True,0.84,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,7won9d,,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust.,"I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their “Phase 1” 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LA’s (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores. 

An elderly man *demanded* the city repair and maintain stop lights. It must have struck a nerve bec",1518300899.0,2018-02-10 23:14:59,70,37,FUTURESPEAKshow,technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7won9d/discussion_i_attended_the_boring_companys_culver/,True,0.77,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,7a7pu4,,Gap between Model 3 and current leased car.,"Looking for some options here so I can start planning ahead/budgeting for extra expenses.  I'm currently leasing a car until March of this year.  My current delivery estimate for the Model 3 is Jan-Mar, and after glancing over the Q3 shareholder's letter I imagine this will be pushed back at least three months^1 ([5k units per week by late Q1]( on 11/1/2017 vs [20k units per month in December]( on 7/2/2017).

I wanted to bounce some ideas around reddit so that I can start planning for this gap that will likely occur between my Model 3 delivery and my lease expiring.  Here's what I've brainstormed so far:

* Extend my lease.

* Buy a cheap junker and hope it doesn't fall apart for 3 months (or 6?  Or 9?).

* Cancel my reservation in favor of a new electric car.

* Cancel my reservation in favor of a used Model S.

* Long-term car rental from Hertz, Avis, etc.

**First Question: Am I missing any options here?**

Second Question: I have a good idea for what most of these options would cost *except* for the long-term car rental.  Has anyone had experience with this?  What I should expect for a monthly rate for these?

Thanks in advance!

The grit, determination, and passion of our team is unbelievable in helping deliver our mission.

And we aren’t done yet! 2025 will have more big milestones with fully ramped dry battery electrode manufacturing to deliver even more cost efficiency. Exciting teams continue to be ahead.

post,eb8y2i,,So many people keep asking me: How will Maxwell DBE technology help Tesla?,"Well, here is the answer:

1. Panasonic has X square feet of space in GF1. And has the maximum capacity to produce 35 GWH of battery cells in a year, with the current technology.

2. Maxwell DBE technology doesn't change the chemistry of cells produced. It only changes the process how the material is applied to the cathode.

3. Put simply, presently, Panasonic dissolves the material in a solvent, applies it to cathode, then dries the cathode, treats the residual solvent.

4. Maxwell DBE process makes a kind of paste of material to be applied on cathode. Applies it on cathode. And dries it up (faster, as paste dries up faster than a liquid). No need to treat any residual solvent (as there is none). So the whole process of manufacturing the cathode takes 1/16th of time & 1/2 of space. So in the area presently occupied by Panasonic, with the appropriate equipment, Tesla can produce 35x16x2 GWH of cells in a year. That is roughly 1 Terra Watt Hours (1TWH) of cells in a year.

5. Additional advantage of DBE technology is that 20% more material can be applied to each cathode in the dry process. So it increases the capacity by 20%.

6. Since the DBE technology process is simpler, cost to produce each cell is 10-20% less.

7. So, in future, Gigafactories may be renamed as Terra factories.

8. This will help Tesla produce more cells for stationary storage (mega packs etc) as well as for vehicles (Model Y, Semi, Roadster 2.0, Cybrtrk etc), without needing to build more Gigafactories in the near future, in USA.",1576464209.0,2019-12-16 03:43:29,6,8,vinodjetley,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/eb8y2i/so_many_people_keep_asking_me_how_will_maxwell/,True,0.8,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,efb3dv,,Seeking advice on a Tesla Solar issue,"While I'm not a big poster on Reddit, I am hoping I can get some advice and raise awareness as well...

Sorry in advance for the long post:

Back in October I got Tesla solar installed. I did it online and had a rep come out to do a site survey to make sure everything was good to go. The rep came out and said that we were looking good and I proceeded with the install. I have about 30 panels and no powerwalls. One of the features of the app that really sold me on Tesla was the fact that I can read not only the solar generation but also what the house is using and what is going to the grid. It really is great to see all of this data and change patterns where needed. I signed the dotted line and got everything installed. 

In order for this feature to work I have come to find that you need something additional installed directly into your electric panel called a powerblaster. I was not getting this great feature to work so I called customer service and this is when I was informed that this was not installed due to there not being enough space in my electrical panel for this to fit. 

I was sold on this feature, informed everything was good to go from the beginning and then only after I paid for everything I was told sorry this was not installed. 

To make matters worse the customer service reps I have called have said there is nothing they can do. The last time I called the rep I spoke with said that she would reach out to a manager and have him call me back. It is now Dec 24th and even though I have called multiple times I have still not heard from a manager on this issue.

Two things:

1st

I want to post this to inform all you are thinking of getting solar to make sure to inquire about this be fore you move forward.

2nd

Any advice on anything else I can do here?

Thanks everyone.",1577242997.0,2019-12-25 04:03:17,1,8,Pug_Face,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/efb3dv/seeking_advice_on_a_tesla_solar_issue/,True,1.0,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,e9vtf9,,Tesla Solar Pricing (California),"Tesla now officers X-Large size (15.2 kW) as an option for solar installation. Looks like a quiet (hidden) update.  Previously there was three options: Small (3.8 kW), Medium (7.6 kW), and Large (11.4 kW). Roughly 12 solar panels per 3.8 kW (12 x 315 W).

Pricing in California (excluding incentives) is now $11,273 for Small, $20,546 for Medium, $30,319 for Large, and $39,093 for X-Large. See below screen capture. I noticed there was a price increase from my previous install price of $10,773 for a small system a few months age.

One can add Powerwall(s) with the Solar installation. A Powerwall is added for each size increase. Total pricing in California (excluding incentives) is $21,786 for Small (1 Powerwall), $34,571 for Medium (2 Powerwalls), $47,857 for Large (3 Powerwalla), and $61,227 for X-Large (4 Powerwalls). See below screen capture.

A $1,000 discount for those affected by outages due to wildfires is still available.

post,e46a38,,Tesla Solar in “Solar Unfriendly States”,"I had a rather ridiculous conversation with a Tesla employee in a local showroom today.  I just had some time to kill and thought I would like have the Model S that they have in there.  He asked if I had any questions and I was wondering about the timeline for Tesla Solar roofs here.  He went off on a political tangent and tried blaming some “recent” legislation on why it won’t be happening here.

This isn’t the first time that I have heard this excuse by solar advocates and it is pretty pathetic.  I am in a “red state” and they passed a law limiting the effectiveness of net metering.  I understand that it isn’t greatly in the favor of solar owners, but it isn’t really that big of a deal... to the point that I still see a positive ROI and want to invest in a solution for my personal needs.

He acted offended when I suggested it wasn’t a big deal and then went on to tell me the work he is personally doing talking with local politicians...  Well, I don’t think he has done anything, but that is besides the point.  He referenced SB 308... well, it is SB 309, specifically Indiana Senate Bill 309.

Prior to SB 309, net metering in Indiana allowed excess energy production to be sold to the power companies at retail rates, giving you a credit.  You would then draw on the credit at the same retail rate.

With SB 309, excess energy production is sold to the power companies at wholesale rates, giving you a credit.  You would then draw against it at the retails rates.

Certainly, not as good of a situation as before for owners of solar, however, it isn’t that big of a deal, plus there are special provisions:

1.	Owners of solar systems installed prior to January 1, 2017 are grandfathered into old net metering rules for 30 years.
2.	Owners of solar systems installed prior to January 1, 2022 get the old net metering rules until 2032.

My normal rates are just about $0.10/kWH and whole rates are $0.04/kWH.  The idea is that you won’t be doing a huge amount with net metering, anyho",1575159509.0,2019-12-01 01:18:29,3,10,DustinDortch,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/e46a38/tesla_solar_in_solar_unfriendly_states/,True,0.67,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

* What work is done. Do they just put in a new roof, or do they redo the framing, etc. to support the added load?
* How much flexibility do we have? I don't like my roof, and have been considering e.g. adding dormers or lofting the roof. Are those the sorts of things it supports?
* What's the quality of the workmanship? They used to have a forever warranty, and now it's 30 years. Does it look like it will last that long without problems?
* How long it takes.
* Generally, what experiences have been like.

post,keio89,,Should future Tesla cars support V2G and V2V?,"Elon has stated repeatedly that since the original Roadster supported V2G and nobody used it, there's no reason to include it in newer models. However, I suspect times have changed and it's now a feature that many would find useful. In conjunction with Autobidder software, it could be possible to sell a few kWh from your car to the grid at peak usage and buy it back to recharge when the power is less expensive, assuming demand-based metering. Since it would require some sort of gateway, such as the one included with the Powerwall, it would likely have to be provided as an option. Or perhaps a new version of the wall charger could include the gateway function.

With the news that the line is being shut down, and that this could mean a potential refresh, I wanted to see what minor features everyone else is hoping to see in a refreshed Model S/X.

For me I’m really hoping for the following:

-	Cooled seats; no one wants a musty bussy 
-	Heated Steering Wheel and arm rests 
-	Real Metal finishes in interior 
-	Surround View Camera 
-	Better cupholders 
-	Apple MagSafe charging 
-	Return of the Sunroof; will be a while before we get a roadster and love the wind in my hair

Are they drawing for the roadster every quarter and just not announcing? Or are they going to batch draw 8-12 of them when that car finally comes out?

post,irvzbo,,"I drove the Porsche Taycan 4S for an hour, and here are my thoughts on the strengths and weakness of it against all the Tesla I've driven.","Due to some luck I had a [Porsche Taycan 4S]( all to myself for about an hour. As a big fan of both Tesla and Porsche, I've driven many of the modern Porsches and I've driven almost all of the Tesla models (including all Performance Model S/3/X except the OG Roadster and the Model Y. I currently DD an AWD Model 3 with acceleration boost. Here are some of my thoughts on many of the aspects of the Taycan from the perspective of a long time Tesla driver.

**Exterior design**: It's all subjective, but I think it's one of the two best looking 4 door sedan on the planet right now, EV or otherwise. Small details like the [headlights]( just really sets it apart from the competition.

**Powertrain**: The 4S is the ""slowest"" Taycan model at *only* 3.8s 0-60. But in typical Porsche fashion it's probably a little quicker than that. It launches slightly harder than my Model 3 (3.9s 0-60 according to Tesla) but definitely won't blow away anyone who's been driving any of the Performance Tesla models. One thing I both liked and disliked was the two-gear transmission. On one hand it pulls hard at speed well north of 70mph (far quicker than my Model 3 at that speed) but despite how amazing PDK is in their ICE cars, that one shift just feels *jarring* in the context of an EV. It's barely noticeable but once you notice it, it's hard to ignore. 

Additionally, it doesn't regen nearly as hard as Tesla does when you lift foot off the throttle, that may be jarring for some EV owners but since I often drive ICE sports cars on weekends it didn't bother me. However I prefer Tesla's implementation as far as an EV experience goes.

**Handling/Chassis/Steering**: The unit I drove had PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) and All Wheel Steering, but did not have the physics defying electromechanical anti-roll bar system. But even then it's **by far** the best handling and best steering EV I've driven by a mile. It weights about 600lbs heavier than my Model 3 yet has less body roll, far bett",1599993260.0,2020-09-13 12:34:20,508,146,cookingboy,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/irvzbo/i_drove_the_porsche_taycan_4s_for_an_hour_and/,True,0.95,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,hl80c1,,Taking a stand on improving Tesla customer support,"**Disclaimer:**

I may take a hit by posting this but I think it could be good food for thought.  **This is not some sort of anti-Tesla rhetoric but a way we as Tesla owners can support each other when there is a clear wrong.**   To be upfront, I have -not- had any issues with Tesla or customer  service in terms of bad experiences (at least not yet).  I mean, I've  been vocal about FSD and how I think they have been going about it the  wrong way in terms of market penetration but that is another topic.

**The Perceived Issue**

Increasingly  over the last several months I've seen a lot of complaints against the  way Tesla handles something or short changes customers.  I am ever aware  that negative feedback tends to stand out more but here on reddit, for  example, there is a very pro-Tesla crowd so I think it is relatively  balanced out.

That being said,  Tesla, while they have grown leaps and bounds since the original  Roadster, is still very much in its formative years and they tend to  make some questionable decisions when it comes to supporting their  customers (sometimes this is location dependent but also tends to affect  the whole when it comes to policy).  So, I have been thinking, aside  from posting in the Tesla forums, posting here in this subreddit and/or  trying to ping Elon on twitter and hope he acknowledges and fixes an  issue, what other avenue do we have?

**Proposal**

My  thought is if Tesla refuses to acknowledge a clear issue and/or tries  to short-change customers, we could protest by hitting them in the  technological money-maker: opting out of any opt-in data that helps them  improve their AI, software and other improvements that rely on this  data.

**Some Issues or Challenges with this approach**

\-  Of course, one person isn't going to make a difference.  But if we  created a customer 'collective', a sizable 'data protest' might be very  noticeable to Tesla

\- Who decides  what issue warrants a data protest by the collective?  This is ",1593886938.0,2020-07-04 20:22:18,68,39,likebutta222,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hl80c1/taking_a_stand_on_improving_tesla_customer_support/,True,0.74,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,h78h21,,Engineering Explained did a good review of the SpaceX version of the Roadster. Most talk is about horizontal thrust. The better approach to me seems to be mostly vertical/downward thrust. Increase traction without damaging surrounding vehicles.,"So there are a lot of problems with horizontal nozzles.  You are shooting compressed air at all the vehicles around you.  So it can only be used in certain scenarios.

If you put the thrust mostly down and then a little in the direction you wanted to go you, you could increase traction with the downward force, not blow the car or people near you out of the way and still increase the 0-60.

I believe and correct me if i am wrong, as you gain speed you need less traction since you have momentum.  So you could lessen the downward thrust as you go faster to reduce the power needed to get the acceleration of a vehicle as heavy as the car would seem at launch.  

Also does anyone know if the mass of the car being lighter but with more downforce would hinder acceleration as much as just a heavier car?",1591915662.0,2020-06-12 00:47:42,7,49,hoppeeness,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/h78h21/engineering_explained_did_a_good_review_of_the/,True,0.61,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

With the best source in the world,[Joe Rogan podcast]( we get that the pressure for the tanks should be 10,000 psi instead of 5,000 psi. That's really all the information we need to calculate everything. Because the ideal gas law, the listed density is doubled from double pressure PV=nRT. 

For the following equations all you need is 

* R = **R** / molecular mass, specific gas constant,
* k = 1.4, specific heat ratio 
* T\_1 = 20 Celsius, 293 Kelvin 
* p\_1 = chamber pressure, 10,000 psi = 68.9 MPa 
* p\_2 = ambient pressure, 1 atmosphere, 100 kPa 
* A\_t = Throat area of the Nozzle

Since presumably this roadster won't be going into space we can just assume the nozzle is sea level optimized, we still calculate the nozzle ratio just to get an idea of how big a rocket nozzle we actually need on the car. A\_t / A\_y 

Some rocket equations, 



Just from the tank pressure and nitrogen's properties we get the exhaust velocity/isp. What we can decide is what Thrust, F, do we want and how long should the burn, t\_p, last? 

The Model S weighs 2250 kg, the roadster is probably around 2,000 kg before adding the rocket propellant (nitrogen gas). Say we want to be able to do 1.5 g vertical acceleration for 5 seconds in order to be able to hover for a while. F = 2000 kg \* 9.8 m/s\^2 \* 1.5 ≈ 30,000 N 

Solving all the above equations you get, 



You would need a 40 cm pressure vessel,  [ this random website sells COPV similar to what SpaceX uses for their cold gas thrusters. 40 cm sphere is also 0.27 m\^3 or 268 liters. They sell pressure vessel that's 43 cm x 260 cm which holds 270 L, or get 3 of the  43cm x 88 cm pressure vessels that hold 80 L and chuck em in the trunk or something, easy.

Model S deliveries began to trickle in June of 2012, and 8-yr unlimited mile warranties will begin to expire in just a few months.  My warranty expiration is about 9 months away.

Tesla Battery Day will take place just a couple of months before warranties begin to expire.  Tesla established a battery upgrade program for Roadster owners, and they did mention they would recycle battery modules and battery components to the extent possible.  A similar program could (and should) also be established for Model S (and eventually extended to Model X, Model 3, Powerwall, Powerpack, Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster 2.0, and whatever else the future will bring).

I hope that as a part of Tesla Battery Day they'll also announce a formal battery upgrade and recycling program for Model S, to take advantage of the advancements in energy storage that they've made over the past 8 years.  Battery recycling is very important, and is right in line with their mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.

The original goal for the factory was for it to be completed in 2020, but as of this moment the factory is still only about 30% completed. In 2017 Elon announced the development schedule would change as they found a way to use the space more effectively. A new year of completion was not announced, so it was still expected to be finished this year.

In my eyes there would be no reason for Tesla to not complete or at least expand Gigafactory 1. Tesla announced the Semi, Roadster and Model Y with original start of production/release date of respectively 2019(!), 2020 and fall 2020 (not looking at the Cybertruck as it is 2 years out). All these announcements were made after Tesla finished building [part F+ of the Gigafactory]( With the Fremont factory bursting at its seams, needing the famous tent as an extra line for Model 3 final assembly and them cramming in a production line for the Model Y, there would be no way production lines of the Semi and Roadster would fit. And I don't expect them to fit in the unfinished Gigafactory 1 either, as I reckon they have been fitting that factory to the brim with all the battery and powertrain production for the Model 3 and Y. So where are they making the Semi and Roadster? Model Y's have been spotted a lot the past few weeks, but no sightings of new Semi trucks or Roadsters while these all should be ready within single digit months. Also, Elon has said on multiple occasions that the Model Y would probably sell more than the S, 3 and X together, but how would they produce these if there already wasn't enough room to produce Model 3's last year?

This made me think that maybe they will still add an ultra capacitor to the Roadster to help it sustain near traction-losing levels of torque and to help with battery temperature management by reducing the amount of cooling needed by taking some of the peak energy demand away from the battery. Then the battery can trickle charge the capacitor. Also the battery can be at a reduced load during peak acceleration to prolong the acceleration benefits of the ultra capacitor. Along with other benefits like improved brake regeneration, battery life, a little extra quick charging by the capacitor emptying itself into the battery pack in preparation for charging so that it can quickly be charged for a few percent of range practically immediately.

&#x200B;

I know this sounds silly, but I want to work through the possibility and why I think Tesla could manufacture 1 million cars in 2021, if batteries can keep up.

First and foremost, for this to happen battery production needs to increase substantially. [Panasonic has recently announced they are ready to ramp production of battery cells at GF1 to 54GWh – up from about 35GWh now]( Tesla has reached battery cell production and purchase agreements with [LG Chem]( and [CATL]( to provide cells for GF3 in Shanghai – we do not yet know the details of numbers, but the deal should support full output of 500,000+ combined Model 3 and Model Y. [Tesla also plans to produce some batteries in house]( – yet to be made official, but an announcement is expected during a “[battery and powertrain investor day]( later this year.

Tesla grew production output by 50% YoY from 2018 - 2019. This was accomplished because of the Model 3 ramp. Looking forward they have several more things working to help them grow faster. They have 4 new vehicles, and 2 new factories coming online or in construction. They are also expanding supplier partnerships and in house manufacturing to tackle growth from multiple points.

Now on to production. Freemont has just demonstrated a [production run rate over 400,000]( units per year when extrapolated over 4 quarters. This does not include Model Y, which has been in pre-production for a couple months, and is expected to begin production in Q1, and reach [volume production by mid-year](

Model S/X production took a hit this year and will likely stay lower for the foreseeable future. Expect 50,000-60,000 units per year going forward.

Model 3 production continued to grow every quarter of the year, wrapping up the year with around [87,000 produced in Q4]( It i",1578094042.0,2020-01-04 00:27:22,184,38,2GoldDoubloons,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ejnq3w/tesla_has_the_possibility_to_manufacture_1/,True,0.89,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

post,kkqm8t,,Autonomous Driving System Confidence and Fault Management - Electrical/Software Only,"Starting to research Tesla just out of basic science interest and I have a broad series of questions I'm having a hard time feeling out:

What is the Tesla's ability to identify, diagnose, and remedy faults related to electrical/software components of the various systems that comprise the autonomous driving features? As you allow the vehicle to drive you, how well does it keep you in the loop with respect to its own performance and ability to ""see"" what's going on around it? Even if there isn't any fault or degraded performance, does the Tesla let you know how confident it is in its own performance? Does it let you know when its confidence in its own ability to safely navigate is not-so-good?

To try to help understand what I'm getting at, below is my general train of thought.

For reference, I used to fly a fairly advanced military helicopter, and it had a robust fault management system. The FMS was a source of constant frustration due to its complexity and inability to give detailed information about detected faults (e.g., having an ""ANTI-ICE DEGR"" fault displayed doesn't give you any information about just how degraded the performance of the anti-ice system will be or why). However, I think there is great value in that kind of advisory so that at least a crew-member is aware that it might not be working as advertised. The other complexity is that understanding all the systems took several weeks of classes and academic learning before you ever see the real thing, which isn't remotely what people do when they get a new car.

Obviously, a Tesla is not as complex as a military aircraft. However, as cars become increasingly complex, and as these complex systems become increasingly safety-critical (as opposed to amenity-related), understanding the real-time state of your autonomous driving system is an important safety concern.

How are manufacturers like Tesla striking a balance between providing enough information for drivers to make good decisions about how well aut",1609019089.0,2020-12-26 22:44:49,2,6,Alex_Xander93,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kkqm8t/autonomous_driving_system_confidence_and_fault/,True,0.55,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

He was the first to go on record that from a manufacturer standpoint the model 3 was put together all wrong, and championed the 179 parts down to 1, and batteries being structural member long before it was unveiled by the company. Sandy knows his stuff. 

For all things concerning electrical engineering, cell chemistry, stock market tips and just basic wizardry, Jack Rickards word was gospel.  Had Jack lived to see battery day I am positive we would all understand a lot more about what was said, unsaid, hinted and implied during the presentation. Sadly that didn't happen as Jack passed away not long before. As an attempt to try to fill at least some small part of the huge void he left behind, I would like to ask (if not fully answer) a few questions I think the battery day presentation raised: 

> [every car company will have long-range batteries, every car company will have self driving cars.](

This clip to me was the biggest bomb shell of the entire presentation. For years we have heard that customers value lies in its billions of miles driven and the dawning age of Robo-taxis creating trillions of dollars worth of value. Also on Tesla’s lead with data from countless charging and discharging self cells, its acquisitions of technologies like Maxwell, and million miles batteries or give it an electrochemical edge above all other competitors when it comes to the cells Tesla has.

post,j2xrzn,,Model Y: 5k miles in and here's what I think so far.,"Took delivery of a black on black performance package at the end of June. I was lucky enough to have received a vehicle within a week of placing the order (my hypothesis is since I was in the Bay Area they bumped me to the top of the list to meet Q2 numbers).

Issues from the factory:

&#x200B;

* Scratch marks on the hood. Corners looked like someone took a brillo pad to it. Tesla service managed to buff it out.
* Paint chips on the panel where the trunk meets the roof. Looks like an object got lodged and the trunk was opened chipping the paint (but no dent). Tesla used touch up paint until it’s barely noticeable.
* Rubber trim lining the trunk was bent out of shape. Tesla managed to steam/press it out.
* Carbon fiber spoiler was coming off. Tesla replaced with a new one.
* Bottom trunk lid had the sticker torn off. Tesla replaced with a new one.
* Car started to track to the right after a few hundred miles. Brought it in at 2k and they performed an alignment at no cost. Steering wheel still seems to be a smidge off (to the right) but car seems to track straight.
* Dual Motor badge was crooked. I didn’t notice till last week. Tesla Mobile Service came out to repair but some of the paint came off with the badge. Have scheduled to bring the car in where they’ll have a outside party touch up the paint before reapplying the badge (slated for next week).
* Turn signals - probably the bane of my existence. Turn signals won’t activate 1/10 times. Have had this looked at twice, the first time Tesla replaced a part. The second the mobile tech said he “reseated some loose wires”. Still not reliable. 

What I added:

&#x200B;

* Tint. Needed this pretty badly to help the AC system. I only got my sides and rears tinted, but I would do the windshield and roof if I found a professional who could do it right.
* Screen protector in matte. Helped with the glare, would recommend.
* Vinyl cover on center all the piano black in the cabin (console and doors). 

Overall:

post,jzkl93,,How reliable is Tesla if important parts are unavailable for years?,"I  was originally planning to buy a traditional sports car.  Then, I  discovered the new upcoming Roadster 2020+ and read about it's amazing  projected capabilities/performance.  That is what made me start learning  about Tesla cars.  I came extremely close to putting down a deposit for  the new Roadster and waiting for however long it takes for the vehicle.

In  the meantime, I was looking at buying a pre-owned Tesla Roadster 2.5  (2011) model.  As I was researching this vehicle, I discovered that the  battery would likely need to be replaced for that vehicle to achieve a  decent driving range, as the batteries in these vehicles that are almost  10 years old are far less effective.

After  doing more research, I discovered that the Tesla Roadster batteries are  unavailable, and they have remained unavailable for the past 3 years!

From  a non-Tesla owner's perspective, I could walk into a Tesla dealership  and put an order in for any of the modern sedan Tesla models available  right now.  I'm sure I would drive them around and it would be a great  experience for the foreseeable future.  To me, however, the real test  with these cars is how well Tesla is able to support it's older models.   It's easy for a sales associate in the show room to tell you, ""You  could drive this around for decades and only replace <these>  parts.""  But can you, really?  When the time comes for you to need to  replace the most important parts in the Tesla, will you be able to?

From the looks of the 2011 Tesla Roadster, that answer is shockingly ""no"".

Granted,  I've never owned a Tesla.  From an outsider's perspective, that is  extremely concerning.  It means that no matter how appealing a  modern/future Tesla vehicle is, if it ends up needing a new battery, new  electrical components, or similar important parts and they are  unavailable as the old Roadster batteries have been unavailable for the  past 3 years, that modern/future Tesla car may end up just taking up  space in your garage ",1606148232.0,2020-11-23 17:17:12,1,28,memorycorruption,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/jzkl93/how_reliable_is_tesla_if_important_parts_are/,True,0.56,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,hnqasx,,Is Tesla Red Really a Good Color Choice?,"I just wanted to see what people thought about Tesla’s red paint. In some lights, I think it looks great, but at other times it looks dull and kinda cheap. I also wonder if a sort of tomato red is sort of a dated color and maybe more for older car owners with soft top convertibles or something. If the common Tesla red was maybe more of a metallic cherry red (like the upcoming Roadster), I’d have no issue. 

But I wonder if it’s worth spending more money on a more conventional black, white, or gray. I sort of like the red, but am not 100% on it, and would never wrap the car in a different color, so I’d basically have to stick with the color I get until a new car.

post,fppeh3,,Long Range Plus,"Yesterday I picked up my new Model S Long Range Plus in Austin.  The service center was busy, end-of-quarter crush underway, I guess.  There was a trailer full of Model Ys waiting to be unloaded!

My car still had firmware dating from last year showing “Long Range” but I updated it last night, and it says “Long Range Plus” now and shows the full rated range.

This is my second EV, my second Tesla.  For the last five years I have been driving a 2010 Roadster, and these two cars could not be more different in their nature.  I’ve had a couple of S and one X, briefly, as loaners over the years whenever the Roadster was in the shop, so I had some idea what I was getting into, but still…

My Roadster is running on its original battery, which after these years can still charge up to around 200 “ideal miles” of rated range.  In practice I can achieve that if I set the cruise control to 60 MPH on the highway, which can be a bit awkward since most of our highways here have a 75 MPH speed limit!  The most I've ever actually driven it in one day was about 270 miles, which involved multiple stops with multiple hours of charging — all at places where I was going to stop anyhow, so it wasn't awful, but yeah…  That was pretty much the whole day.

Although not the performance version, the S LR+ is *not a slow car.*  By the numbers, it’s a little quicker from launch than my non-sport Roadster.  Overtaking at highway speed is much stronger than the Roadster and feels a lot like my old Lotus Esprit V8 did.

But the range!  Charging to 80% and then reading out 312 miles range is *unreal!*  Picking up the car with a 77% charge, driving home 100 miles, and still having more miles left than my Roadster even starts the day with…  It's like science fiction.  That completely changes the way I even think about using it.  Oh yeah, and it came with Unlimited Free Supercharging!  The Roadster can’t even use Supercharger stations.  It’s like I’m stepping into a different world with this.",1585277923.0,2020-03-27 03:58:43,50,5,ZobeidZuma,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/fppeh3/long_range_plus/,True,0.93,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,fej0ux,,My Coal-Powered Car,"This morning when I finished some shopping (not in my town, but nearby here in central Texas) and came back out to my car, there was a huge SUV (Ford Excursion, maybe?) parked next to me, and a white-haired man was with it.  As I was putting my stuff in the trunk, he made a comment that sounded at first to me like ""That's a cool car, isn't it?"" which is something I'm fairly used to hearing.  Then I played it back in my head and realized that it actually sounded more like ""coal"".  So I asked him, ""Coal-powered car?""

Yes, he asserted again that my car is powered by coal.  So, I told him that where I live there are wind farms going up everywhere.

He said:  Oh, those!  Well you know, those wind turbines don't really work.  They aren't even turning most of the time, and they're usually broke down or catching on fire.

That was news to me.  I told him we've had huge wind turbine components trundling through our little town regularly for *years* now, and no end in sight.  It's hard to see how that's possible if wind power isn't working out.

Then he *explained* to me that the only reason all those wind farms are being built is because of government subsidies, and whenever they do actually manage to produce some power it's wildly expensive.

I didn't really want to continue that argument, so I shrugged and moved along.  It did kind of irk me, though.

I don't want to give the impression that this sort of thing happens all the time.  I've had the Roadster for five years, and this is only maybe the second time that I've ever been roped into a dispute of this sort.  Where I live the whole ""green"" aspect isn't even on most people's radar; the subject doesn't come up.

I’m looking at the SR or SR+

I want to get autopilot, so I was wondering if the missing features in the SR vs SR+ are worth the $2000 difference. Has anyone bought the SR+ that feels like it might have been fine for them to just pick up the SR and pocket $2000? 

And the other thing is the audio. I do love listening to music during my commutes, I’ve heard the premium audio is great but not $9000 great. Has anyone upgraded either the Sr or Sr+ audio, if so what did that entail and how good does it sound?",1580621292.0,2020-02-02 06:28:12,5,30,Project_aegis,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/exjney/looking_to_get_a_model_3_got_some_questions/,True,0.78,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ejcst7,,Tesla Powerwall Emergency Setting + General Questions,"So I was looking at putting 75kWh of Powerwalls on the house and shed I'm building with with about 30kW of solar.

The builder apparantly has this scheme that he's getting more info for where we lose the backfeed for 10 years and it pays for the system. All good. Hence why I'm looking at such a big system. Plus if I buy an EV in future, the backfeed will be minimal. So I'm not sure how the solar company is sinking here, but the builder says they're still winning. NMP.

Now I've heard that in an emergency, I can activate the Powerwalls to top off from grid and isolate the house, is this available in Australia?

I've also heard it's locked until an emergency is declared, now how does Tesla go with for that declaration? Because for example in NSW, these fires have been burning since before Christmas and a State of Emergency has only just been declared, now the individual fires were declared at ""Emergency"" status, but the state wasn't declared in emergency until recently.

Lastly, will a Powerwall system work with a Non-Tesla EV? Or an older Tesla EV? For example [This model S is still $70,000]( so it's certainly not a new model. I don't want to potentially get an older S or an original Roadster and find that it's not compatible with my system.",1578041263.0,2020-01-03 09:47:43,2,6,Rumbuck_274,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/ejcst7/tesla_powerwall_emergency_setting_general/,True,0.75,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I'm driving an SR+ and I'd like to start the trip with a 100% charged battery.  If I set the ""Scheduled Departure"" time at 4am, will the battery be at 100%, or is that just to get the car up to an appropriate temperature by that time?

Would it be easier for me to reduce the charge rate on the car so that, from a math stand point, the car is forced to charge from 70-100% at a reduced rate that completes the charge when I want it to be ready?

post,k3f6et,,"My Model 3 SR+ Road Trip Experience - Seattle, Seaside, Bend and Back","I originally posted much of this to a daily thread in r/teslamotors a few weeks ago,  folks seemed to like the write up so I figured I might post it here where it wouldn't be lost among the traffic of the daily thread.

In late September we took our first road trip in our M3 SR+ we bought in early April and our first road trip in an EV of any sort. We went 1271 miles in 5 days. Our trip took us from our home near Seattle to the Oregon coast and then over to Bend, OR and home again. I'm definitely happy with how it all turned out and thought I'd share my experience.

I'm impressed with the supercharging network in the Pacific Northwest. We were never incredibly far from a supercharger during our whole trip. I was also pretty happy to find quite a few places with Tesla destination charging available along the way allowing us to press on further. It was also amazing to be able to charge overnight at the places we stayed.  It was wonderful to wake up in the morning to find that I had a full ""tank of gas"" so to speak.  I only had a mild amount of range anxiety one time when the nav system told me I'd show up at the supercharger with 15% of the charge left. We had lousy weather on this stretch of the trip with driving rain along the way, using heat, and over mountain passes and a headwind. But, we arrived at the supercharger with exactly 15% of charge remaining. According to Teslamate, we spent 4h21m at Superchargers during the trip, most of which we spent watching shows on Netflix and going in to the nearby Fred Meyer to pick up something to eat. Mostly waiting to charge was not a hassle and provided a good break for us to get out and stretch our legs.  It's pretty nice that most Superchargers seem to be near some sort of amenity, around the northwest anyhow they almost always seem to be near Fred Meyer stores.  I didn't really run into any situations where the Superchargers were particularly crowded or any broken chargers.

As for costs, we had 1000 miles of free superc",1606676944.0,2020-11-29 20:09:04,14,6,MrHorrible2048,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/k3f6et/my_model_3_sr_road_trip_experience_seattle/,True,0.89,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,jzfmsa,,A robotaxi bullcase,"So I calculated for myself, how I expect the robotaxi segment of Tesla to develop and came to a few really insane numbers. I feel like I can make some educated guesses for robotaxis, but I know too little about the trucking market, solar, batteries, etc. to make similar calculations. I thought that maybe someone here would find this interesting, so let's see:

**Robotaxi workload**

Robotaxi drives 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening during classic rush hour. Over the rest of the day, robotaxi drives a total of 2 hours with passengers. No drives at night. Makes a total of 6 hours of driving with passengers on board.

**Miles per hour**

How many miles drives a robotaxi per hour? Well, it's mostly inner-city, much stop and go, traffic lights...I say 20 mph to be very conservative.

**Profit per mile**

ARK Invest has calculated, that Tesla could offer robotaxi services for 0.18 $ per mile. Let's say Tesla sells each mile for 0.25 $.

**Days driven per year**

EVs need little maintenance, but we should calculate some. Cleaning and minor repairs could be done during the day, as the robotaxi isn't active all day (see above). Let's calculate 35 days per year of downtime, roughly 10 %, or 330 days of driving per year.

**Margin**

A bit speculative. Tesla archives an operating margin of about 20 % right now. I would suggest, that Tesla's profit margins are at least 40 % with robotaxi, this is most likely way too conservative.

**Amount of robotaxis in 2030 and 2035**

So, very ambitious but Tesla wants to build 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. That means a giant supply chain is in place. Most of these cars will be compact cars, as this market is the biggest. Tesla has a history of success, so let us assume they can do it. Well, if FSD actually works, I judge it highly likely, that Tesla will focus hard on robotaxi production. Robotaxis IMO will include compact cars as well as robo-buses, which will carry like 10 people, offering lower prices to customer",1606129280.0,2020-11-23 12:01:20,2,2,DarmokAndJaladAtTana,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/jzfmsa/a_robotaxi_bullcase/,True,0.57,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

It will show full regen available until the moment you start to use it then whooop suddenly half an inch of regen dots appears and your car slows way less quickly than you were expecting. Not exactly safe to not have a good idea of how your car's braking system is going to behave at any given time, in my opinion. 

On a semi-related note, I feel like I am experience way more regen and acceleration limitations at warmer temps than last year. It has been in the low 40s and I charge to 60% every day but even then, I am having regen and acceleration limitations. Last year, I would see a small amount of regen limitation but acceleration limitation was super rare and only seemed to occur when it got in to the low 30s and below and the car sat outside for a long time.",1603992360.0,2020-10-29 18:26:00,1,10,diezel_dave,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/jkee85/regen_available_bar_misbehaving_on_408/,True,0.56,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,k6dhbx,,First Grid outage w/ Powerwalls - a few questions,"For those of you with Powerwalls that have experienced Grid outages:

1) Is it normal for your electronics to sound a bit ""different""?  I noticed humming/buzzing from appliances and devices that was not definitely not there prior to the outage.  I pull from Powerwalls every evening in Self-Powered, but still Grid connected, and have never noticed these noises.

2) Do any of you still  use Uninterruptible Power Supplies? I figured this would be needed to keep PCs and Servers running during the cutover to Powerwalls when the Grid goes out...but my PC without a UPS did not restart so the cutover was near-instant.  I suspect this may be because the sun was down and I was already pulling from the Powerwalls.  Does the cutover take longer if you're pulling from Solar and the Powerwalls are idle?  I just want to avoid my PCs and Servers restarting during the cutover.

3) Is there any reason why a UPS would not charge from the Powerwalls?  My UPS (APC 600VA BE600M1) turned off after 30 minutes as if power was out, and would not turn back on when running off of Powerwalls with no Grid.  This does not happen every other evening when I run the Powerwalls in Self-Powered mode Grid connected. This one makes no sense to me - the outlet was powered and would run another device just fine. I'm trying to figure out if I need a new UPS, or if another UPS will just have the same issue due to how the Powerwall works when not Grid connected.

post,z2y1a3,,Is speed a gimmick after a certain point?,"I recently drove both the 330i and the m340i. Obviously the 340i is way faster but i wonder if it actually makes the car actually more fun on the streets? In a way, I kind of found the 330i funner on normal streets. Here's why:

&#x200B;

1. On normal city streets, w/ the 340i you get to 40 mph after like 1 gear change, and then have to put around at relatively low RPM. It feels like you're going 10mph in a parking lot, not 40. The 330i is at higher rpm and gets more gear changes. It also just feels like you're going faster.
2. On the freeway, its a similar story. You get to enjoy acceleration for a few secs but then you're at 80 and you just have to coast. You can't tell you're going fast without looking at the speedometer.
3. Both cars handle similarly in corners if you option it correctly. And its easy to let the back out of both of them.
4. W/ particle filters, both have similar fake engine noise and you can't hear the actual exhaust much.

Obviously if i was comparing an integra to the 340i, ofc the speed difference would make the car more fun.  


I think also, the 340i isn't like model S fast where you get extreme g force, which brings its own fun.

This just makes me think that speed is kind of a gimmick to compare spec sheets, but practically its not necessarily more fun.

Today marks one year of owning my Turbo X (and daily driving it)! Happy anniversary to my favorite car.

Saab - you don't get it until you do. And I can say that now I totally get it. There's a reason Saab drivers have a massive grin on their face when they're behind the wheel. I apologize in advance if this gets long, but I have a lot to say about this fantastically unique vehicle.

**First off, about the Turbo X, and what makes it different from any other 9-3.**

The Turbo X was only produced for the 2008 model year in celebration of 30 years of turbocharged Saabs. This was also the first Saab to feature the XWD system - Saab's proprietary 4-wheel drive system.

The Turbo X differed from a standard 9-3 with more power, stiffer suspension, carbon fiber effect trim, and larger brakes. It also features a different turbo gauge from the standard 9-3 which takes inspiration from the classic 900 Turbo. Only 2,081 production models were produced, of which 632 were imported to the States.

post,yjhuve,,Dodge Shows Crate Hurricanes and Hellephants at SEMA,"[Dodge]( is unleashing a fleet of Hellephant crate engines at this year’s SEMA show. The Hellephant debuted at [SEMA]( in 2018 as a stand-alone, 426-CID crate engine that boasted 1000 hp. Now Dodge and Direct Connection will sell you a whole array of Hellephant models that range in power and displacement. Dodge is also peeling the curtain back on its Hurricane inline-six-cylinder engine platform, and its plans for next-generation crate engines.

Kicking off the Hellephant line of engines is the entry-level 376-CID, iron-block Hellephant C30, which advertises a cool 900 hp. Cranking it up a notch, Dodge will push that same 376-CID Hellephant to over 1000 hp with the Hellephant C170. The different names represent the percent of ethanol in the fuel (like proof you’d find on a bottle of liquor). If you want even *more* power, Dodge still offers 426 CID Hellephants under the A30 and A170 banners, with 1000 hp and 1100 hp advertised respectfully. All of these V8 mills sport a 3.0-liter supercharger on top and have upgraded internal parts compared to the production Hemi engine.

If that’s not good enough, Dodge and Direct Connection will also offer race-ready Hemi mills. Direct Connection will feature two race-ready Hemi engines in its catalog: the Drag Pak Hemi that makes an NHRA-certified 630 hp from 354 CID, and 1500 hp from the 426 CID Hemi. Though if you’re going to want to snag one of these, you’ll need a deep bank account. The Drag Pak Hemi will set you back $56,995 and $59,995, respectively. 

Dodge isn’t only flexing its Hemi might at this year’s SEMA show. The team at Dodge and Direct Connection are also making the [I6 Hurricane engine available as a crate package]( This turbocharged I6 will be available at three power points: 420 hp, 550 hp, and over 1000 hp. This 3.0-liter I6 will carry the Cat1, Cat3, and CatX names, and be sold under the HurriCrate banner. 

Making this HurriCrate engine even more interesting, the CatX engine is slated to be the next Drag Pak",1667329453.0,2022-11-01 20:04:13,115,44,dillgaff1,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/yjhuve/dodge_shows_crate_hurricanes_and_hellephants_at/,True,0.91,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,y06qa9,,Bye bye Tesla. Hello Hybrid Accord,"I just returned my 2022 model 3 for a 2022 Hybrid Accord and couldn’t be happier.

Tesla, and maybe every pure electric vehicle (atm) is not for me. 

Some reasons that led me to my decision:

- I rent (so no charging overnight). I would gladly pay more money to avoid time loss at charging station. Time > money 
- I also wanted in on the newest tech (FSD). It’s largely pretty cool but I found myself in some pretty sketchy situations. Also, too many phantom breaks.
- Electric cars are ugly. Tesla is just less ugly.
- It would do Tesla well to have some control levers. Not everything needs to be done from the touch screen 😵‍💫

I think sometimes that owning a Tesla (for some) is more about status than utility.

post,x4d1g4,,"Poor reliability isn't the only issue with EV fast-charging. Even when working as intended, the current design of EV fast-charging in the US is not fit for universal adoption (including Tesla Superchargers). Here are 10 problems that will need to be addressed for an all-electric future.","TLDR: If EVs are truly going to fully replace gas cars then recharging an EV should be as convenient, consistent, and fast (within reason) as refilling a gas car. With the current EV fast charging design, that won't happen. So the charging sites that we're deploying today will eventually be outdated. We should start future-proofing today so that we spend the resources on something that will still be useful in 40 years.  

First things first, this a US-centric post about DC Ultra-Fast Charging. Some of it will apply to other countries, but not all. This is not referring to Level 2 or fast charging in areas where you’re meant to spend significant time like the movie theater or shopping mall. I also don’t care about any of the excuses for why it is this way. “It costs too much”, “Peak demand charges”, “The technology isn’t there yet”. None of that is my concern. The message has been sent that EVs are the future, so I am simply pointing out how the design of fast charging needs to improve in order for ICE to truly become obsolete. One of the first things that I was taught as an Electrical Engineer was to ensure that my designs were as future-proof as possible. Obviously, this is difficult to do with an emerging technology like DC Fast-Chargers (DCFC), but when billions of dollars are being poured into the transition to EVs, we should be making every effort to ensure that the money spent today isn’t wasted on something that will be obsolete in a decade or two. If the US is serious about transitioning from ICE vehicles to EVs, then we need to ensure that charging is as easy and convenient as filling up with gas. I also am not here to talk about things like reliability, number of charge sites, location of sites, etc. I am trying to focus on what’s wrong with the sites when they’re working exactly as they were designed to. That being said, here are 10 problems with the current design of EV Fast-Charging sites in the US.

post,wfflk9,,Launch Control is still silly. I updated my sorted list of 5-60mph times to better reflect cars' real life acceleration performance.,"It's been more than a year since I did [this post]( Since then many new cars have come out and I thought it's appropriate for me to update the test a little.

For context, many popular magazines that do 0-60 tests on new vehicles measure them with the use of launch control. This mostly eliminates the effect of turbo lag, throttle delay and power delivery curve difference for many high performance cars that would all make significant differences in real life situations. Further more many American magazines subtract rollout time from their 0-60 result, which further downplays the difference in traction between different setups.

Which is why Car and Driver's 5-60 time is in my opinion the most accurate gauge of real life ""stomp-and-go"" acceleration scenario. So here is the updated list, with one additional column at the end (+x.xs) for some cars showing the discrepancy between the 0-60 and the 5-60 time. The larger this gap is the less representative is the car's 0-60 number of its real life capability. 

I've also removed cars from the previous list if there are newer models available.

post,ttbqoj,,The Electre SUV might actually be a great Lotus.,"Wait, hear me out! I can explain!

We all know that Lotus, as a car brand, stands for very specific things. The mantra of “simplify, then add lightness” is beyond legendary. Lotus never stood for gigantic amounts of power and torque; straight line speed was never quite their thing as much as handling was (I know I'm ignoring things such as the Lotus Carlton but please focus on the point I am trying to make). Over the years Lotus developed a reputation for flawless handling, which was the result of perfect chassis balance, beautiful suspension, amazingly communicative steering, innovative ideas, and a relentless search for lightness. So, when a few years ago Lotus decided to introduce the Evija, people rightfully expressed concerns as to whether that car truly followed the ethos of what Lotus represents. After roll a 3000lb+, 2000hp monster machine doesn't really sound like something Lotus would do. And now, horror of horrors, Lotus is building a 2 tonne, 600-1000hp electric SUV. This is something that will cause many to be inclined to think that Lotus has lost its way. 

However, I do not think that is right:

Many think of the Evija, as a heavy car unworthy of bearing the Lotus name plate. But I think that is a big mistake. See, the Evija might weigh twice as much as an Elise, but it is in fact astonishingly light. In fact, compared to other EV hypercars it is an absolute featherweight. Take the Rimac Nevera, its closest competitor: that car is 400 kg heavier than the Lotus. The idea that Lotus managed to build a car with that big a battery, that much power, which weighs so little, AND is road legal is absolutely incredible. With four-wheel torque vectoring, perfect chassis balance, incredible aerodynamics, and an advanced suspension system, that car is a technological tour de force that strives, in true Lotus fashion, to be as light as possible. If that doesn't sound like Lotus to you, I do not know what does. And sure, it might be prohibitively expensive for the ",1648766348.0,2022-04-01 00:39:08,2,5,The_Dyff,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ttbqoj/the_electre_suv_might_actually_be_a_great_lotus/,True,0.53,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,soedun,,Questions regarding undercoating for my truck,"I live in Michigan, so salt and rust is a major issue. I recently got an '18 Sierra, and hope to have it for a long time. That said, rust is the biggest concern I have. 

From what I've read, most people say just stick with Fluid Film and call it day. The problem is I don't have the means to easily do it myself, so it would be a pretty big undertaking to do it once or twice a year. I haven't tried too hard, but I haven't seen any local shops that offer it, or at least none that advertise that they do. Most do Krown, which I've heard to avoid.  I also hear people saying to stay away from rubber/tar coatings as it can actually make things worse. This brings up 2 questions:

&#x200B;

1. A local Line-X dealer uses ValuGard, which they describe as a wax/petroleum hybrid. The application process is to clean the frame first, then they ""fog"" it with the anti-rust and a wax sealent, then apply the hard Line-X black coating. This seams to be a better process then just spraying some FLexseal on it and walking away. Is this a better process or just some smoke and mirrors to make me feel good? They would give it a 7 year warranty if the car is less than 5 years from the model year. 
2. If it isn't a good process, why is it worse then nothing at all? I'm just curious how it would exacerbate rusting, as I've seen some people mention, since the water and salt can get trapped behind any imperfections. But if it's wide open to the road and air, it always has exposure. Wouldn't this help lessen the total area that's exposed?

post,sd4fbh,,"I daily drove a 2001 Ferrari 550 Maranello for 2 1/2 years, AMA","Hello /r/Cars,


I first fell in love with the 550 in 1998 when I saw a video of a red one on a track being expertly tossed by what looked like a properly skilled/crazy driver who sang praises of its handling and power, in addition to its GT comfort and understatedly elegant design.  At that point I made up my mind that I just had to find a way to own one someday.  Then Bad Boys 2 came out and it was confirmed that mine would need to be Grigio Titanio.  Almost 20 years later, I found myself in the very lucky and privileged position to begin my search for a 550.  The “perfect car” was on consignment at a Ferrari dealer in Southern California; a 2001 final model year example in excellent condition with only 21,000 miles, rare carbon fiber interior, Daytona seats, one-off custom BBS LM 19” wheels, and a McIntosh show car stereo, the removal of which drastically improved performance and handling.  Our goal was to make it the ultimate daily drivable example through the addition of tasteful modifications designed to improve upon the original design and purpose of the car, as well as the overall driving experience.

Here are a few photos of the car:







The ownership and improvement processes have been an experience in themselves, and sharing the car and the dream with our family and friends has been beyond fulfilling.  It was not always a smooth journey, but the hiccups allowed us and our mechanic to identify the weaker areas of the car and remediate them with the goal of building a reliable platform capable of reaching 100k miles and beyond with only minor maintenance.  Electronics and heat were our biggest challenges, and thankfully our mechanic is a brilliant fabricator and electronics specialist.  He spent 14 years managing one of the larger Ferrari dealer service shops on the West Coast, after which he managed tech for a Ferrari race team for 5 years before settling into his own independent operation.  The most significant improvement was a world-first fuse board ",1643198587.0,2022-01-26 13:03:07,487,117,smilesperwatt,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/sd4fbh/i_daily_drove_a_2001_ferrari_550_maranello_for_2/,True,0.94,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,sb7c3z,,My 2019 Model 3 LR vs 2022 Model 3 Performance vs 2022 Model Y Performance Comparison,"I currently own a Tesla Model 3 that is near the end of its lease. The hope was that by the time my Model 3’s lease was over other manufacturers would start to have suitable competitors to Tesla in the EV space. While we’re starting to see that happen, most options are either way out of my price range (Taycan, Audi E-Tron GT) or feel like they haven’t quite matched Tesla yet in terms of range and performance (Polestar 2, Jaguar I-Pace, etc). The BMW I4 M50 is something I’m definitely keeping an eye on, but I could run into availability issues just knowing when my lease is due. So I decided to go to my local Tesla shop to try both the Model Y Performance and Model 3 Performance to see how they stacked up to my current car. 

Since I am already coming from a Tesla I am not going to highlight things like technology, charging infrastructure, etc. I mainly going to focus on the differences between models in terms of design, handling, power, and things that would be most relevant to folks who are a bit more concerned about the overall driving experience.

Lastly, I did only have 30 minutes with each car. But I was able to drive the cars on about 40% of my daily commute and on roads that I am very familiar with (the Tesla service center is a few blocks away from my house). So this is about as apples to apples of comparison as I think I can reasonably give. I do think it’s helpful that I was able to drive these cars back to back and on roads that I know well. 

**Handling:**

**Model Y Performance**

I have to be honest in saying that I am not at all someone who has ever considered a CUV due to my personal emphasis on driving dynamics, however I was pleasantly surprised by the Model Y Performance. 

The steering on the Model Y feels very direct and the car is quick to respond to changes of direction and steering inputs. You feel more like you are driving a regular car as opposed to a land barge like many SUV’s that I’ve been in. Though I didn’t necessarily push the Model Y ",1642980961.0,2022-01-24 00:36:01,47,22,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/sb7c3z/my_2019_model_3_lr_vs_2022_model_3_performance_vs/,True,0.73,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

The car has been an absolute blast to drive and honestly pretty reliable all things considered. If you want to buy one, check out rx8help.com for a read on what you should know. 

If I could re-do it all, I might buy a Series 2 RX-8 R3 and do less mods, or just buy the new GR86 / BRZ. It's definitely been a fun journey with this car though!

This is something I’ve been meaning to do (those NSX yearly reviews really inspired me), but u/DarkFire989’s review gave me the kick in the pants to get this started. Here’s my one-year review of my 2004 Mazda RX-8 that I bought in December 2020. I hope by the end of it, you can take away and understand the following:

* Why I took the leap of faith on this specific car
* My perspective on rotary / RX-8 maintenance (it really isn’t that bad)
* The appeal of the car from a tuning and driving perspective
* Pros / cons and quirks, and comparisons

Going to try to keep it somewhat concise, if you have any more questions on anything by all means ask!

**The buying experience**

In late 2020, I was in a position to own a car again after deciding that I was going to move out of NYC. Wanted to get into a sports car again (I had an Infiniti G35x daily and NA Miata sports car before) that I could semi-daily (WFH life), and I was pretty flexible budget wise as long as the car was something I would like, a good deal, and generally reliable. I am partial to high-revving sporty cars that’s slightly “out of the norm” to help you understand my biases.

post,z4tty2,,Model Y Performance ownership wrapup (2 years),"I recently traded in my MYP after two years and roughly 24,000 miles and wanted to share my ownership thoughts and some of the highlights and lowlights of the car.  This assessment is coming from a long-time car enthusiast and not an EV evangelist or EV hater.

I’ve done my best to leave out commentary on the community and the management of the company–while both of those factored into my personal decision to get rid of the car I wanted to focus on the merits of the car itself.

Tl;dr:  EVs do performance, packaging, and livability really well.  And they are going to be the future.  But my next EV is going to be from somebody other than Tesla.

***The good***:

* **Storage and interior space**:  
   * Between the massive under-trunk bin, the funk, and the flat rear passenger floor there is just an obscene amount of space for cargo.  I don’t think anything else can touch the MY for the sheer amount of discrete storage spaces.  Interior passenger space is also very open and roomy.
* **Acceleration**:  
   * Far quicker than any car its size has a right to be and the #1 reason I bought the car in the first place.  Power is accessible instantaneously and without drama–no launch control cheating, just stomp the long pedal and go. 
   * It’s the first car I’ve owned where I didn’t get used to/bored with the acceleration over time–it’s quick enough off the line that it just hits at a visceral level.  While acceleration falls off quickly over 60-70mph, there is more than enough for effortless passing at highway speeds.
* **One-pedal driving**:  
   * Love it.  In my daily commuting I would almost never touch the brake pedal.  The OPD is super dialed-in and very easy to modulate.  And it was downright fun to get the “perfect stop” where you rely only on regen and stop the car right on the mark.
* **Running costs**:  
   * While it liked burning through expensive tires, in two years the only consumables I had to buy were tires, windshield washer fluid, and cabin filters.

post,woyyo9,,"I bought my first auction car, and I did it sight unseen, yup... im that kind of idiot.","Do you want the quick version or should I summarize? 

Summarized version; car auction purchase = apocalyptic disaster. 



Extended Version;

I like to frequent a semi-local (2 hour drive away) online auto auction house that specializes in selling bank/credit union repossessions. 

As you can imagine, most of these vehicles are a) American and b) not cared for. Chances are if someone financed a 2009 Chevy Equinox, the likelihood that they are well off financially is pretty low. Chevy Equinox indeed; most of the vehicles on here are undesirables. But every once in a while you come across a diamond in the rough, or so I thought would be... 

One Tuesday evening, I happened across one of my ""to own"" bucket list. You know, that list of cars you always wanted over the years but never found an opportunity to buy for cheap. Well, here I am; on that list is a 5 Cylinder powered Volkswagen Jetta, I had preferred a Sportwagen but realistically I had no need for one as I currently also own a Nissan Pathfinder, so I could get a sedan and give it daily driver status. 

The auction had a few hours left, and I pondered for about... 12 Seconds.

""$3000 is my Maximum Bid"" I said (to nobody but still out loud for reasons beyond comprehension), if it goes for more than that I won't increase. I place my bid and promptly... go do something else and completely forget that I even bid for a car that evening.

I wake up the next morning and start my routine, your typical dash for the coffee maker and creamer as the required morning pick me up. I sit at my kitchen cable, half eyed, staring at my phone screen, sifting through the junk mail and typical things I signed up for but didn’t actually sign up for.

“Congratulations! You’re the high bidder!” 

Shit. I actually won it. Well, This is it, my first sight unseen car purchase. A 2009 Volkswagen Jetta SE with 107K on the clock, from Virginia.

post,t7kfyf,,US Ford Fiesta ST: 2 year ownership review,"I had written a long reply yesterday to someone about my experience with my Fiesta ST and was told I should submit a post based on it. 

I bought my [2018 Ford Fiesta ST]( just over 2 years ago, 2 months before the start of the pandemic. 

My previous car was a [7th generation Honda Accord V6 6 speed coupe]( which I had for just over 10 years.

My Accord ran as well the day I sold it as the day I bought it, my major reasons for getting rid of it was that I wanted more practical cargo space, a bit more fuel efficiency and most importantly for me at the time, 4 doors. 

Another major reason for buying my Fiesta ST at that point was that Ford had discontinued the Fiesta (and all of their other cars except the Mustang) after the 2019 model year. If I was to buy a Fiesta, I wanted to buy one new as I had seen so many owners modify their cars. 

 I had been interested in the Fiesta ST after seeing it featured by various car journalists I follow. ^[1]( 

I still spent several months doing test drives of all the hot hatches available to me before making my decision. Cars I tested included the Focus ST, Focus RS, GTI, Golf R, Civic Type R, Veloster N & Hyundai Elantra GT Sport. 

I ultimately went with the Fiesta ST due to its size, fun at normal driving speeds (I drive mostly under 60 mph, predominantly on city/suburban roads with a bit of highway) and competitive price. 

The cars which came closest for me were the GTI & Veloster N. I rejected the GTI because my mechanic warned me about higher repair costs & the Veloster N due to it only having 3 doors. 

Here are my impressions after 2 years of ownership: 

Pros:

**Fun**- I have fun with this car every time I drive it. One of my biggest requirements was to have a car which I can feel like I'm driving recklessly while actually driving fine at normal speeds on city & suburban roads.

My 6-6 Accord accelerated so quickly that I just didn't have enough time to feel the acceleration on roads with less than 45 mph speed limits",1646519170.0,2022-03-05 23:26:10,96,56,cocoagiant,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t7kfyf/us_ford_fiesta_st_2_year_ownership_review/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,t4odz9,,I spent February renting and driving enthusiast cars.,"There are countless videos on each of these cars but you never know the full picture until you actually live with one. I rented each car for 4-10 days and drove ~400 miles per rental. I'll tell you what I thought of each car with 2-3 sentences, and then pros and cons just below if you want to know a little more.

#**Lexus LC500**
This car is theatrical in every aspect. Engine sound, interior and exterior design, even the gauge cluster. But it's a large car for something trying to be a sports car and there's almost no space to put anything inside. I can't imagine paying $100,000+ for a car this big with less storage than other GTs.

**Pros:**
- Futuristic styling with theatrical interior and exterior.  
- Incredible muscle car engine note that pipes into the cabin very well.  

**Cons:**
- Absolutely terrible infotainment you won't be able to (easily) replace.  
- The smallest trunk for a car this size. The packaging is questionable.   
- Not as fun to drive as other cars in this price point. Feels boaty.  

#**The Ioniq 5**  
My second rental. My first non-Tesla EV. This may just be the best value EV on the market with a sticker price $10,000 below a Model Y but with the same size, similar range, and excellent roomy interior. The biggest downside with my week of ownership was Electrify America where I had to find a new stall to park **FIVE** different times as each stall I pulled into had a unique problem. It actually took me longer to park and troubleshoot than it did to charge.

**Pros:**  
- Gorgeous spacious interior that makes anything else feel cramped.   
- Really fast charging. A 15-20 minute stop is truly all you need.  
- The closest thing to what Tesla provides in ownership experience with a range that went beyond what was claimed. I loved this car.  

**Cons:**  
- Start/Stop Button. It's an EV! I shouldn't have to tell it to turn the ""engine"" off.   
- There's a frunk that just shouldn't be there. You can maybe fit a laptop or a sack lunch. It is that t",1646185369.0,2022-03-02 02:42:49,256,78,asimo3089,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/t4odz9/i_spent_february_renting_and_driving_enthusiast/,True,0.93,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Just because it “looks cool” doesn’t float in my book. Tesla needs to do a redesign their truck if they even want to compete if you ask me, to be fair though I’m just a dude complaining. 14,000lb tow capacity is great there’s no denying it, but Ford has a regular looking truck that is electric that can do 10,000lb tow capacity and still have a decent range with tow included I’m picking the Ford.

I have been looking at Rivian but I need to know more about it before giving an opinion so far it seems like just a great competitor in the electric truck market.

My current Miata is a 2008 NC with a fabulous power retractable hard top. LOL--I felt like I had arrived :)  But I have had my eye on either a 350Z or a 370Z for a while now. Hubby is my mechanic and is pretty picky. We found a fabulous 2015 370Z roadster that just ticks all our boxes and should be bringing it home this Saturday morning.

I am 5' so of course being able to see over the steering wheel and dash is always thought. It seems pretty good on the test drive. Any other short people out there that can tell me how they fit in the car?

I noticed more blind spots than I have in my Miata so I am guessing you just learn to work with it?

While I am still hoping that someone creates a decent sounding electric car without the use of fake noises from speakers, at the moment what determines whether or not I like is if the styling works with the lack of sound. I can't really explain it but basically if a electric car looks to similar a muscle car or a Ferrari or any car that I associate with a wonderful sound, I won't like that. Only a few cars have avoided that for me.(Porsche Taycan, Porsche Mission R, 2nd generation Tesla Roadster, Tesla Model S, new Delorean, on the fence with the Lucid Air) Basically the more futuristic a electric car looks, the more I'll probably like it, unless it is ugly as hell.

post,u635yi,,A once in a lifetime opportunity wasted,"I recently went to a car show near my college campus. Nothing too crazy, mostly 90s-10s German and JDM, nothing I hadn’t seen before. I had noticed what I thought was a 190SL roadster, you know, the smaller engined, far cheaper sibling of the legendary gullwing in the far corner, and figured I’d make my way over to it eventually. 

After working my way through the rest of the vehicles and chatting with some other attendees, I’d forgotten about that old Mercedes in the corner. I spotted it again and decided to go check it out. 

I approached it from the front and gave it a look. I’d never seen a 190 before so I thought it was pretty cool. I walked around to the back. 

**300** SL. 

I was awestruck. Holy shit, a 300 roadster. 1.4 million atleast. I was drooling over it when someone walked up and popped the trunk.

Obviously the owner, someone I need to talk to. I told him he had a beautiful ride, and he said he drove it 90 minutes to the show. 

This guy drives a 300SL on the highway. Wow. I was talking with him some more, and I mentioned where I went to school. I told him, and he said that he was alumni, but his graduation date was about 65 years prior to mine. 

He then asks if I knew stick and if I wanted to take it for a quick spin.

The owner of one of the most iconic cars of all time just asked if I wanted to drive it. 

Only one slight problem…

This thing is insane. So much power in your hands. I don’t know how to communicate it in car enthusiast terms so, I will just go based off my feelings. When you put your foot down, you feel yourself get thrown back. You feel your brain and body get thrown back. It feels like you’re getting smushed by a steel press very quickly (G-forces?). In return for this smushed feeling you are greeted with an absolutely intoxicating sound with gurgles and pops and bangs and a deep growling that only stops when you tell it to. One thing I really love about the F-Type is that when you want it to be loud and rambunctious then when you want it to be quiet, you just switch off the active exhaust. I’ve always thought that it would get exhausting to listen to a loud exhaust all the time when you’re driving so, being able to have it when you want it is great. 

I went to the back roads of the Sam Houston National Forest because I’ve always heard that that’s where you go when you want to just enjoy the drive and I agree with this!

post,1jizskm,,Can someone explain Elon Musk’s Claim on empathy?,"I'm not a fan of Elon, but I have a genuine question for those who might have some insight. Elon Musk recently said that ""the biggest weakness of the West was empathy."" I don’t want to strawman him—I genuinely want to understand what he meant.

Surely, he can’t be referring to the fundamental human trait of empathy—the very thing that, alongside intelligence, likely gave us the biggest evolutionary advantage over other species and helped us become the dominant force on this planet. Even conservative evolutionary biologists wouldn’t deny that. Empathy allowed us to build large, cooperative societies, which had a clear advantage over smaller, fragmented groups. If the majority of humans didn’t have empathy and we had all always resembled a person with ASPD, I’m sure we would still be living in caves. There's maybe a point that it could be advantageous if our leaders were psychopaths, I wouldn't like that but I can see the logic behind...

If you were to remove empathy completely, what would you replace it with to maintain a functioning civilization? The only alternative I can think of is something like the Borg in *Star Trek*—pure collectivism hive mind without emotional connection nor personal freedom.

The carmaker’s “low-cost” Model 3 vehicles are already moving through assembly lines on a trial basis, and Musk heralded the “massive” stamping machines and in-operation paint shop. He also confirmed media reports that a second building is under construction in the Shanghai complex to handle battery and module production. Tesla hopes to produce 1,000 Model 3s a week from the factory by the end of the year. It will also produce Model Ys, its affordable crossover model, at the plant.

In its earning report, Tesla said it is working to finalise its local manufacturing license and to meet “other governmental requirements” before ramping up production in Shanghai.

post,1jfpo6n,,I’ve been very impressed by BYD while visiting Brazil,"I’ve been in Brazil for 15 days and love this BYD dolphin. When I first saw it, I did not love the styling, but it’s been an absolute joy. I’ve driven Teslas (model 3 and model y) up and down California numerous times. The BYD feels more luxurious and less cheap in almost every way. 


I have not experienced a single phantom breaking while in a BYD. I had 3 in one day the last time I drove a Tesla. On the byd, the driver assistance has just worked. 


The interior is MUCH better. Tesla seats and interiors feel cheap. The stealing wheels wear quickly due to how thin the material is. I thought a Tesla was quiet due to the lack of ICE, but the BYD has much less road noise on wayyy shittier cobblestone roads. The seats are more comfortable and EVERY surface material feels more less cheap and flimsy.


The car is much more intuitive than a Tesla. The Tesla OS is always a pain to figure out where basic shit is. I had to pull over and watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do something on a road, but have found the dolphin to be very intuitive. The screen also rotates from landscape to horizontal which is nice to watch YouTube. Charging has taken 20-40 minutes each time.


On the whole, the BYD felt like a proper luxury car (think lexus) while the Tesla just felt very cheap and gimmicky. If we could get BYDs in CA, I’d buy one when I got back. The Dolphin plus is R$169k which is under $30k usd.


TLDR: the BYD dolphin is surprisingly nice and I want one.


Edit: I’m a California lawyer who is passionate about cars. My business / family fleet is currently:


Rx 350 f sport, Yukon Denali xl, 4Runner, forester xt, mazda 3, Corolla, a 2023 model y, and 2 Tesla model 3s (2019 and 2024).

post,1in45al,,Do performance cars have a positive effect on a company outside of the profit of selling them?,"Been thinking on this, I feel like they do in a ton of ways. Yeah it brings attention to the brand for consumers, but it also brings attention to potential employees and can legitimise the company in the eyes of buyers, investors and admirers. 

Like I'm a Toyota Apprentice, a good chunk of why I like Toyota is I admit because of Initial D, their cars are well designed and their line-up of fun cars like the Celica and 86. My other options were Honda, Mazda, maybe BMW and Renault. Like, why choose Mazda or Honda over VW or a far larger brand or even Tesla? Because VW is boring to me and I hated Tesla before it was cool, being a tech is very much about passion because you really do need it in order to get good, learning a lot in a little at the start otherwise it's like pulling teeth. 

Also having a performance car helps show a car company isn't just ""adequate"". The Kia Stinger and Hyundai I30 N are the apex of this effect. Both showed that South Korea companies could make great cars and legitimatised them as a actual car manufacturer worth paying attention to. So many people were surprised about just how good they are, overnight Hyundai went from a literal joke in The Sopranos and Tokyo Drift to being seen as just as good as the rest. I30 N production was shut down quite quick but that's because, it did its job, people get a lot of advice about cars from people they know who like cars, so Hyundai or Kia was no longer a dirty word.

post,1i51u89,,Went to the local auto show and it was pretty underwhelming.,"**TLDR: Auto show kinda sucks now and i probably won’t go back**


We used to go to the car show every year but we stopped attending because every year it got more and more watered down. Decided to go this year for old times sake and it was disappointing. 


The area for the manufacturers cars was like ~1/3rd what it used to be with tons of brands being completely absent. Basically no luxury or EV brands. The rest of the space was taken by vendors and the (bigger than it used to be) custom car section. The overwhelming majority of cars I wanted to see were absent. Probably won’t go back, and if the new Charger hadn’t been there I probably would’ve called the day wasted tbh. Went with one of my parents and basically nothing they wanted to see was there. 


More detailed thoughts: 


* The main car I wanted to see in person was the EV Charger and props to Dodge it was right near the entrance. 


* Jeep has had some variation of an indoor track with a steep hill you drive over every year I’ve gone and they had it here again. Love it


* Ford’s exhibit was insanely basic. No 2 door Bronco, no Raptors, no Lobo, no Dark Horse, no Mach-E Rally, etc. 


* Subaru had a good exhibit. The BRZ tS was locked, which is funny because the WRX tS was right next to it and had full access despite being more expensive. They also had a good spread of base vehicles and a couple Wilderness models. Even had a Solterra. 


* Toyota had the whole GR lineup all 3 cars in red and unlocked full public access. They also had a neat row of tablets with live configurators and even a nice sitting/rest area.


* Cadillac didn’t try at all, though ig they get props for being the only luxury brand to even show up. One base Escalade covered in smudges and a couple basic EVs, with no brand reps that I saw.


* Nissan had a bunch of cars, a trivia game with a Lego GTR prize, and some other contest giveaway. The Z was there, though you had to wait in a line and fill out a survey to get to it.

post,1hvkoei,,Tesla parts can now be ordered from them directly online,"Tesla already has all of their factory service manuals online, which is incredible if you need to work on the car. However, you previously had to go into a service center to buy parts from them. They've now updated their online parts catalogue to support ordering. Between the service instructions and now parts, I don't think any other manufacturer makes it this easy.

  
**EDIT**: I'm going to leave this up rather than delete it, but it turns out this is only for ""businesses."" I tried to submit an application and was denied as an individual. What this means is that your local shop will now be able to fix your Tesla with genuine parts and have them in stock, but as an individual you still need to go to the service center to buy them. Hopefully it is extended to everyone in the future.

post,1kxrc5b,,"Leno's Law [35 year smog exemption in CA] has passed a major hurdle, but lost some of its teeth.","Around a month ago the 35 year smog exemption was placed in suspense while the appropriations committee spent more time on it. On Friday it successfully made it out of the appropriations committee, and should (hopefully) get a full vote by the CA senate.

But in the appropriations committee they made some modifications that make it somewhat less useful. The important part of the current amended text now reads:

***(c)  For purposes of subdivision (a), a collector motor vehicle, as defined in Section 259 of the Vehicle Code, is exempt from those portions of the test required by subdivision (f) of Section 44012 if the collector motor vehicle meets all of the following criteria:***

* ***(1) Submission of proof that the motor vehicle is insured as a collector motor vehicle, as shall be required by regulation of the bureau.***
* ***(2) The motor vehicle is at least 35 model years old.***
* ***(3) The motor vehicle complies with the exhaust emissions standards for that motor vehicle’s class and model year as prescribed by the department, and the motor vehicle passes a functional inspection of the fuel cap and a visual inspection for liquid fuel leaks.***

Both (1) and (3) represent a significant modification from the previous text. It looks like you'll have to submit some paperwork to do.

(3) Makes it unclear to me what actual benefit this bill will have if it gets passed. This gives the department (DMV) significant leeway to prescribe emissions standards that could really moot the whole point of the bill. We may not have a good idea what those will be until this is actually implemented, but I'm not overwhelmingly hopeful given the history of this kind of thing.

Some will argue I should’ve let them consolidate down to one of their own while I kept mine, but part of the reason they are in bad financial shape is because they bought things to keep up with the joneses without budgeting for maintenance. And since they’re providing the roof over my head, I kinda have to give into their demands until I live on my own again. 

Since I’m mechanically-inclined and they aren’t, they gave me their old Mercedes ML320 to drive around while I job hunt. This car has lots of deferred maintenance but it is drivable. 

Now I’m thinking when I do start working again, maybe I should just go all-in and refurbish this car as much as I can to prevent tying up cash into a car payment again. It seems to be what a lot of my friends and old colleagues are doing. 



Edit: woah, this is an incredible amount of input. Glad to hear of everyone’s experiences. I guess my goal is to make it through this rough patch as much as I can manage, knowing full well there are better options out there later on.

post,1jhltve,,A C8 Stingray Owner's Extensive Corvette E-Ray Review,"I’ve been pretty intrigued with the hybrid concept of the C8 E-Ray. I used to own a C8 Stingray but sold the car partially because it just didn’t feel as fast as my Model 3 Performance. As an EV owner I’ve grown accustomed to a lot of EV “niceties” regen braking making traffic easy, basically never having to think about traction, and tons of power and torque whenever I want it. 
Because of this, ICE vehicles have been appealing to me less and less, but hybrids are starting to pique my interest more and more. I genuinely feel like hybrids could provide the best of both worlds, the engagement and visceralness of an ICE vehicle, with all of the convenience and efficiency of an EV. 

There’s also a pretty strong debate within the Corvette community on whether E-Ray or Z06 are the better buy. The C8 Z06 is my favorite car I’ve driven thus far, but a lot of Corvette folks feel like the E-Ray is the better buy for the pure street driver. 

So I decided to rent an E-Ray on Turo for the day to see if it was a hybrid good enough to satiate the EV lover, but also to see if it was worth buying over a Z06. 



Before diving into my thoughts I want to note that I’ve spent a significant amount of time in quite a few other cars the list of vehicles is shown below. 

C5 Corvette, V6 5th Gen Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, C8 Corvette Z06, Model 3 AWD, Pre-Highland Model 3 Performance, 2018 Mercedes AMG-GT, Porsche Taycan Turbo, Taycan GTS, Taycan 4S, 997.2 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Ford Focus RS, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400, Lotus Elise, McLaren 720S and the 2017 Acura NSX. 


**Hybrid Power:** The power delivery on the E-Ray is pretty unique and takes a little bit to get used to. The E-Ray has an immediate low-end throttle response, very comparable to what you’d expect from an EV with light throttle inputs. This initial throttle response is really more optimized to get the car rolling f",1742686422.0,2025-03-23 00:33:42,53,24,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1jhltve/a_c8_stingray_owners_extensive_corvette_eray/,True,0.98,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,1j7uaf1,,The previous generation Chevy Equinox is a miserable experience to work out of.,"This is partially a complaint about the car, and a complaint about how the requirements of my job make it horrendous to sit in all day. 

For the past 2.5 years I’ve logged about 30-35 hours per week sitting in this shit box. It’s absolutely terrible to work out of as a fleet vehicle. In those two years I’ve gone from the trim that they send to rental fleets (lowest of the low) to a mid level trim of a slightly newer model year (2022) with upgraded seats. 

I mention the seats being “upgraded” because there is not a single comfortable way to sit in this thing. No matter how many adjustments you make you can’t get around how the side bolstering forces your shoulders to curl forward. I have a wider upper back and my shoulders being in that position has led to upper back pain. It’s absolutely miserable. Last Friday I drove about 350 miles in this thing and my back was screaming by hour 8. 

Everything else in the interior is gaudy and cheap Chevy BS. Horrible infotainment who’s only saving grace is Apple car play. Still is incredibly unresponsive and being touchscreen only is a pain to use. 

As far as crossovers go, this thing is tiny on the inside. The trunk especially is a major disappointment. None of my gear fits and I’ve tried every possible orientation. The current system I have is just barely acceptable and requires I stack my gear in a precarious way. 

Gas mileage is okay? Definitely not a segment leader. Id estimate a 50/50 split of highway and city driving and average 23.5mpg. It’s not my gas, so let’s be honest I don’t really care , but I can’t understand why a normal commuter buys this over a RAV 4. 

0-60 time is mediocre. 8.9 seconds according to google. And as someone who is constantly merging onto highways it’s something I always think about in regard to my own safety. Couldn’t get out of its own way if it tried. You punch the gas and it loudly revs up to 4-5k RPM, and you’re left wondering why you aren’t at highway speeds yet.

post,1hrm1fp,,My thoughts driving a McLaren 720S around Japan for 6 hours.,"Found myself in Tokyo for the holidays and decided to try out a 720S on a guided driving experience around the Hakone region. 

I’ve always wanted to try a McLaren. I used to own a Lotus Elise, and I’m a big fan of the Evora and a lot of folks say that McLarens are what Lotus would or could be if they didn’t run out of money. Likewise the car guy in me sees how quickly some their models can depreciate and I feel like they’re the most “obtainable” exotic from a pricing perspective.

Here's a link to the car in question: 

I’ve driven quite a few other vehicles that list includes: 

C5 Corvette, V6 5th Gen Camaro, C7 Grand Sport, C8 Corvette Z51, C8 Corvette Z06, Model 3 AWD, Pre-Highland Model 3 Performance, 2018 Mercedes AMG-GT, Porsche Taycan Turbo, Taycan GTS, Taycan 4S, 997.2 Porsche 911 Turbo, 718 Porsche Cayman Base, Alfa Romeo 4C, Alfa Romeo Giulia QV, Ford Focus RS, 2008 Audi R8 V8, Audi TTRS, Lotus Evora N/A, Lotus Evora 400, the Lotus Elise, and the 2017 Acura NSX. 

**Ridiculous Power:** I’ve driven quite a few high powered cars and this one pretty easily dwarfs everything else I’ve been in. A few seconds at partial throttle finds yourself very quickly breaking the speed limit, and you very much get the sense that if you actually floor it in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd gear from a low speed that the car will kill you. I’d describe the acceleration as violent and relentless. You feel yourself get pinned back to your seat pretty quickly and you get the sense that the car can just pull and pull. This is probably the only car I’ve been in where I’ve gone “This truly has more power than I need on the road” and I like fast/powerful cars. Likewise a lot of vehicles I’ve been in just don’t feel fast any more thanks to EV’s providing so much more torque and power, if you’re coming from an EV the 720S will be sure to satiate your need for power.

post,1jifwfx,,An interesting phenomenon - the Disappearing Veloster N?,"Firstly, I may just be crazy, but I've been around the car scene for a very long time. I live in a very congested place with a very large and established car scene.

Before COVID, I used to see Veloster N's everywhere. I mean, everywhere. They were popular due to the price point ($24-30K USD) making it one of the absolute best price to performance cars of our generation. Then COVID happened and a very interesting event unfolded:

Used Car ""buyouts"" from places like Carvana were offering INSANE buyouts on Veloster N's paying people $32-35K USD for cars that were purchased off the lot for nearly $10,000 less. And I knew many people who took advantage of this goldmine opportunity, I even watched people go buy off the lot VeloN's and immediately flip them to Carvana for a payout. (Or equivalent locations buying Used cars)

But now, something is very bizarre - this model of car that sold thousands of units in the States in my area has all but...vanished. You see them no where, I literally went to a very large car show this weekend and not a single N car was there.

It's like they've evaporated from existence. I've seen a handful of Elantra N's now (close to 10-20 on the regular in the area) but Veloster N's have just...vanished.

Now if the car was 20 years old, sure I get it, they get into accidents and totaled out with time. But this car debuted in 2019 and ended production in 2023 - just 2 years ago.

Where did Carvana send all these cars? Who has them? No ones driving them, no ones selling them - Carmax in the states shows ""3"" just ""3"" NATIONWIDE. Autotrader only shows 42 of the 4,000+ that were sold NATIONWIDE. I find this fascinating; because I know a truckload of these things were traded in during the pandemic for the cash payout.

It's like they've just been erased. Is anyone else noticing this? Did Carvana just ship these all overseas? Is Dubai loaded up on LHD Velo N's?",1742781243.0,2025-03-24 02:54:03,267,115,BroxigarZ,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1jifwfx/an_interesting_phenomenon_the_disappearing/,True,0.94,2025,elon,search,False,False,0,
post,1jfc9yh,,"Bought back my dream car, a C7 Z06","Back in 2019 I made a post about purchasing my dream car, a factory ordered C7 Z06 with a manual. Almost 5 years later I had an opportunity to buy a first model year 2023 Z06 at MSRP that someone had backed out on so I sold my C7Z.

  
Before and after that I've enjoyed quite a few different vehicles but they weren't the same, I always missed my C7Z and have been on the look out for the perfect one. I'm quite picky so the car needed to be red or yellow and have certain options like comp seats, carbon interior etc.



I came across a 2016 C7 Z06 C7.R special edition in January. For anyone that doesn't know what that means, basically its a fully loaded Z06, it had Z07, ceramic brakes, exposed carbon splitter, side skirts, hood, comp seats. Basically every option possible except it can only be had in black or yellow. It also has unique wheels with yellow stripes and the Corvette racing jake skull on the hood and C7.R graphics on the roof. GM made 500 of these for the US and 150 for the rest of the world, they all have a unique vin. Mine is number 422 and was actually imported from the US to Canada in 2018.

  
Besides the carbon fiber and Z07 it is optioned similarly to my last C7Z except its yellow instead of red. For a 2016 it only has 5500 miles on it and has fully body ppf. Nice C7 manual Z06s are still going for good money and are difficult to find, this was 1 of 3 coupes for sale in Canada so I jumped on it as it was the perfect build for me.

  
With the weather starting to warm up I've taken it out a couple of times for some quick drives and its everything I remember. Its not as loud as I remember but the C8Z exhaust is hard to top, I'm not sure how its legal from the factory, its still good though. The shifter feels great, the clutch is easy to use, the view over the hood is awesome with the fender sticking out and then it drops down into a canyon before come back up to meet the supercharger bulge.

post,1j5mxva,,Some observations on the automotive-related internet space.,"Semi-old timer here - been around long enough that I'm sure I have shitposts out there on some forum about the release of the original Fast and the Furious movie - thought I'd share thoughts based on what I see here and elsewhere. 

Positives:

*  Frankly, the sheer amount of information available is insane. You can find a dozen reviews/videos about obscure shitboxes from 20 years ago within seconds.

* Usually, any car-related news is reported on within minutes by multiple different sites/channels. No longer are you waiting until the next magazine to hit the shelves to find out what's coming up.

* Car-related discussion groups are so large and diverse that you can get perspectives you didn't even know existed. You'll get a 17 year old from Australia, a 31 year old from Finland, and a 54 year old from Mexico all talking about the same vehicle/video/etc. It's really crazy when you step back and think about it, and probably underappreciated. 

* Knowledge levels are (again) almost hard to believe. Even on this sub, it's almost guaranteed that no matter the topic, someone with way more knowledge than anyone should have will be able to chime in.

Some negatives:

* Spam. So much goddamn spam. I know my view is warped as a moderator and dealing with all the shit that doesn't actually make it to the sub, but sometimes it feels like fully 2/3 of the people that come here are trying to make a quick buck.

* Prolific levels of downright shittery. People treat each other like shit, argue about the dumbest things, and generally act like they have to be ""right"" all of the fucking time.

* Everyone feels like they have an ulterior motive. So many people are trying to push some agenda (or otherwise benefit from other users) that you start looking at everyone and wonder if they're genuine. 

* Zuckerberg, Musk, Bezos, Huffman, etc... it's all trying to be controlled by these folks.

post,1kqw8br,,Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Massive Crash and Drama,"It looks like not a lot of the English-speaking community has picked this up, so I wanted to do a quick write up.

So, for the headline crash: during the Hyundai N Festival N2 Cup Masters championship, a massive 4-car crash happened at an estimated 110km/h:  (timestamped; 4:40:22 if it doesn't work)

Note car 017 is the first to crash; you can see them spinning out shortly after cutting to the drone view. 

Unfortunately, while nobody was killed, there are rumors that one racer has suffered 3 fractured bones.

Now for some context behind the drama:

**The Hyundai N Festival**

This is an annual event sponsored by Hyundai (and a few other companies like Kumho tire) and operated by ""Playground"" (just a separate LLC sponsored by Hyundai) where they have sponsor booths, food trucks, showcasing cars, etc. The highlight of the festival are the spec race series.

There are three classes: eN1, N1, and N2. [eN1 is run with moderately modified Ioniq 5N chassis with a rollcage, suspension, brakes, widebody, and mild aero.]( [N1 is similarly modified, but with Elantra N instead](


**N2 Cup Woes**


N2 is the problem child. N2 is a mostly stock Elantra N with a bucket seat, half-rollcage, steering wheel, brake pads, and a spec semislick tire. 

No suspension modification of any kind, nor brake modifications are allowed. The point is that Hyundai is marketing a mostly-stock Elantra N can be driven in a wheel to wheel race and still be okay--if you're active in the US track scene, in fact it mostly is... on a track day.

Since the series began, the N2 cup was shrouded in some hot water. Almost every year, there was an incident where tires were debeading off of the wheels.

[Elon Musk]( 

I have been an avid supporter of Tesla since placing an order for my Signature Model S.  I can not, in good conscience, stand by and watch Elon succumb to the unjust strong arming by the questionably motivated SEC.

I plan to form a [petition]( and would like to know what else I can do to support Elon... this is absolutely insane.  

In the recent fan made video, a clip highlighted Elon saying that he would never give up!  I realize the weight of the world has been put on his shoulders, but kowtowing to the SEC in this matter is 100% wrong; it also signals a victory for the cancerous oil lobbyists that have been gunning for Elon since they realized they are 5-10 years behind the curve.

I am absolutely devistated, as an owner and a shareholder, that Elon would agree to admit he was wrong when he has already emphatically stated that he rejects the SEC’s claims of acting unethically.

The intent must be examined; and there was never an intent for his tweet to manipulate the market.  The only manipulation has, for YEARS, been the greedy short position holder that constantly spew negative stories, unsubstantiated claims, and target attack without merit.

I stand by Elon, Tesla, and the world view being held by so many of your supporters.

When I joined this sub as a mod (over 4 years ago), /r/elonmusk barely had 2k-3k subs. It was very niche and the users were folks who either admired Elon Musk or had just heard about him and were intrigued and wanted to learn more about the man. If you would like to time travel back to what this sub was like back then, click [***here***](

Over the years, several key events have propelled Elon Musk into the mainstream media. A few of those being:

* May 19, 2015 - [***Biography about Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance***](
* December 21, 2015 - [***SpaceX Lands Orbital Rocket Successfully***](
* March 31, 2016 - [***Tesla Unveils Model 3***](
* June 1, 2017 - [***Elon Musk Leaves Trump’s advisory council***](
* November 16, 2017 - [***Tesla Semi truck (and Roadster) launch event***](
* December 17, 2017 - [***Elon Musk comes up with idea of The Boring Company***](
* Feb 6, 2018 - [***SpaceX launches Falcon Heavy, puts Tesla Roadster in Orbit***](
* July 6, 2018 - [***Elon Musk helps build submarine to rescue kids stuck in Thailand Cave***](
* July 18, 2018 - [***Elon Musk apologizes to diver he previously called a ""pedo"" in now-deleted Tweets***](

post,8en3im,,"The BFR: too big, too soon?","Or not?

The most important and most remarkable development in the human breakout into Space is SpaceX. What SpaceX and Musk are doing is what the general space community had been longing for, and tried to develop in fits and starts for many years. But I have to observe the whole BFR issue from the standpoint of having worked in and watched the unfolding history of space transportation development. BFR looks like a “bridge too far” after the very savvy and practical approaches of the Falcon series to date.

BFR is “too big,” and “too soon,” because there’s no market emerging in the near future for it. Also, the underlying premise behind BFR is to accelerate Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars. This is a mistake. Evidence and documentation is emerging that implies humans, in their present evolution, are not likely to thrive as permanent residents off of Earth. Long-term visitors, yes, but a lifetime, or even being born “out there?” Not likely. I can elaborate on that at another time, but suffice it to say that Mars is not a sober goal for having 1 million humans by 2100. And building a civilization on Mars with chemical rocket transportation, even if that is just meant for a first phase, is highly questionable. But that is what drives Musk, and why he, ultimately founded SpaceX.

Meanwhile though, he’s developing what’s turning into the most successful space transportation system ever. That comes first. And Musk knows that if BFR is to succeed, it must first fulfill actual needs much closer to home. Hence such schemes as the “point-to-point” ballistic transportation idea. That was something first advanced by Robert Heinlein. But generally, one starts “small” with such ideas. BFR is not small.

BUT, WHO ELSE, OR WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

While people like myself would prefer a more cautious evolutionary approach, it is Musk/SpaceX, and eventually Bezos/Blue Origin who are leading the drive for the one-two punch of less expensive space transportation, and human space settlement",1524597333.0,2018-04-24 21:15:33,2,7,rareilly,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/8en3im/the_bfr_too_big_too_soon/,True,0.58,2018,elon,search,False,False,0,

Some managers tried to emulate Mr. Musk’s never-say-no style, but “without being as smart as Elon,” says Mr. Foster, who didn’t interact with the CEO regularly. “I struggled with the culture and am extremely happy I am no longer there.” He now works at Samsung Electronics Co.""

post,9kobe4,,Are the short sellers running a campaign to lower TSLA stock price?,"I am pissed about how Elon Musk is being treated. Am I not getting it, or is this how it is?

Here is my semi-informed opinion. 

&#x200B;

Elon Musk and Tesla Motors have done amazing things so far. They have revolutionized vehicle design and manufacturing in a very short time, and singlehandedly created the market for electric cars.  


At Tesla, he set seemingly impossible goal and consistently meets it, although usually a little later than his original ambitious plan.  


They have revolutionized the auto industry and vehicle design, and are now about to earn more revenue than they are reinvesting in new vehicle design and their charging infrastructure.

&#x200B;

After a nine-month delay, they are finally meeting their ambitious production targets for the Model 3 (estimated at 53,000 for the third quarter 2018 vs 50,000 to 55,000 target).  


So, Tesla and Musk obviously deserve to be celebrated for a stunning victory for American design and manufacturing.  


But instead, they are being hounded by media, wall street and the SEC.  


That's because some very powerful people bet against Tesla, and don't want to lose money. So, they are using the government people and media that they own to bring down the company.  


If they succeed, the next American success story is less likely to happen.  


Musk and Tesla need our support.  


Reach out to your representative and Senator to let them know that you notice what the SEC is doing. Ask them why the perpetrators of the 2008 financial crisis that put about 10 million people out of jobs and their homes haven't been held accountable after 10 years, but after 1 tweet, Elon Musk has to step down from as Tesla's Chairman of the Board (and perhaps be replaced with someone of their choosing?)",1538461591.0,2018-10-02 08:26:31,21,13,pizzamanisme,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/9kobe4/are_the_short_sellers_running_a_campaign_to_lower/,True,0.87,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

Then I was just thinking about The Boring Company and where I imagine them to be in 10 years. 

Well, let's use Tesla and SpaceX as reference. 10 years ago Tesla had just started selling the Roadster. They were hardly a company anyone thought would be anything like it is today. Maybe like 50 people on the planet thought it would be a big player in the auto industry in just 10 years. 

SpaceX had just completed the first successful launch of Falcon 1 September 2008. At this point, I wonder if even Elon himself imagined he would actually get to the point he is today with SpaceX. That would be an interesting thing to ask him though. 

I'll tell you one thing, I think perhaps Elon has accomplished more in 10 years than any other individual maybe in all of history depending on how you look at it. I wonder if there is something to this Elon being an alien thing.

post,8g8uk6,,"Elon, The third Industrial revolution, and cryptocurrency","For each industrial revolution, there were advancements in communication, energy, and transportation 

1st=Print, coal, steam engine

2nd=Telephone, fossil fuels, cars

Future revolution=Internet, cheap renewables, and self-driving vehicles

The future supply chain will be powered cheaply by advanced solar and wind energy, run by AI machines all connected and controlled through the internet. This will make almost all business more efficient thus allowing an economic boom.

Elon will be involved in all these areas with Starlink, solar city, Tesla, and SpaceX.

In addition to supply chain improvement there will also be big improvements for consumers:

Housing bills- (Solar City) install a solar roof to supply your energy or buy energy from your neighbor with excess energy from his solar roof. Blockchain technology (power ledger) allows the peer to peer sale of solar energy thus eliminating the middleman, saving the consumer money and reducing effects on the environment. All house appliances and heating could be run on this energy. In addition to power and heat, your internet/phone/TV may also be supplied by Starlink depending on its success/cost. (optimistic)

Transportation- (Tesla)You could either own an electric car and charge it via the energy mentioned above or use driverless taxi service. For long distance use BFR earth to earth to fly across the globe in less than an hour. Or to Mars!!

All of these systems can be implemented anywhere in the world. In this future, a portion of the global spending on bills and travel could be paid indirectly to one company/ companies owned by Elon. Why not make your own global currency to allow ease of entry to all citizens of the world and reduce fees? Enter cryptocurrency. This crypto coin could allow you to pay for energy, internet, driverless taxis or BFR flights. With the cryptocurrency, many other blockchain applications can be applied such as supply chain tracking, vehicle records, p2p energy trading and others yet to be ",1525184857.0,2018-05-01 16:27:37,114,67,oneshotwillis,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/8g8uk6/elon_the_third_industrial_revolution_and/,True,0.89,2018,both,search,False,False,0,
post,8d7pzi,,The Musk Brothers are currently prototyping the colonization of mars.,"From Kimbals shipping container no dirt, low water farms. he is prototyping the technology and Technics in Brooklyn right now, he is practicing for mars.

To Elons underground transportation system and digging capability. The boring company currently is working on earth and will be for 5+ years but the end goal is mars. Mars has higher radiation and to get by that you can go underground for shielding from said radiation. whether its transportation tunnels for longer distance hyper loops(or simple walking tunnels/cars maybe?) or to have the capability to dig out habitation tunnels that require only the digging machine instead of having to bring along or build walls... hyper loop is currently being prototype on earth where it will have the best use on mars connecting colony's over long distances(that may be 25+ years but he is still anticipating it)

Elons Space x is currently designing and building a interplanetary space ship which is self explanatory on its long term purpose 

Solar city and solar roofs, again working on new technology under the control of Elon . not only will this work on earth to fund the technology development on mars. 


Overall in the perspective of a mars colony what do you need, Food, water, air, electricity, transportation(to mars and on mars) and shelter. The Musks are working on solving the hard problems when it comes to colonizing mars. And they will do it.  Air and water are reasonably straight forward and do not need the most focus when preparing for mars. Nasa and other space agency's have spent a lot of time and money on closed loop water systems. i am sure more work will need to be done though

post,5qw8wm,,An infrastructure prediction before we find out what The Boring Company is all about. (x-post r/BoringCompany),"Before ground is broken on whatever this tunnel project turns out to be, I wanted to register a guess as to what Elon's BoringCo Los Angeles tunnel could look like.

I think Elon has a long-term plan to help alleviate California's transport woes, all borne of his daily commute in famous Los Angeles traffic, which is most likely a straight line up and down the 405 between Hawthorne and the Santa Monica Mountains. Pending regulatory approvals (which I know nothing about), Elon could start digging from below or beside the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne, in a NW direction mostly inline with the 405. This would pass just west of the Inglewood Oil Field.

Digging could be performed by some new design of TBM that Elon hasn't shared yet, with perhaps additional machinery to expand the tunnel outwards once the initial tunnel has been bored. If he's serious about this idea, which is tough to gauge, then he's probably got an idea or two about how he's going to accomplish it. Don't ask about timelines, though.

In the short term (BoringCo LA v1), once the initial tunnel has been bored, Elon can completely eliminate his personal commute time. As soon as the v1 tunnel, however narrow, passes through the nice neighborhoods in the mountains, he's home free. He can even justify it as being ""in the best interest of humanity"" due to his rapid iteration on systems that improve our collective quality of life. It wouldn't be the whole point of the exercise, but a nice temporary perk. For science.

In the long term (BoringCo LA v2), however, this first tunnel traveling along the 405 through LA would turn into a multi-lane (8? 10? 12? 14? 16?) freeway reserved for swarm-enabled self-driving vehicles. Swarm driving would completely eliminate all bottlenecks (and [paradoxes]( associated with modern driving; with a swarm of vehicles driving synchronously, we could avoid phantom braking and reach unprecedented speed and throughput on freeways and in tunnels. A tunnel could also be an opportunity t",1485724985.0,2017-01-29 22:23:05,3,2,BoringCurious,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/5qw8wm/an_infrastructure_prediction_before_we_find_out/,True,1.0,2017,elon,search,False,False,0,

post,689t8c,,Upcoming ways to watch Elon Musk's interview from TED 2017,"X-post from [SpaceXLounge]( because this sub was instantly deleting my posts for awhile.

So without further ado, from an event organizer I emailed:

> Elon Musk didn't give a talk, but just gave the interview with our CEO Chris Anderson. It covered such a wide range of topics  – really fascinating stuff, and put a cap on the conference's theme, The Future You. The atmosphere in the auditorium was electric!

Anyway these are the possible ways to watch the interview with Elon at TED 2017, soonest to longest from now:

* 1) Someone posts an unofficial version online given Elon's high profile. I think this is somewhat unlikely since TED runs a tight ship but who knows

* 2) [TED Cinema Experience]( **This Sunday**, many theaters will be showing a $17 2-hour highlight reel from TED 2017. The interview with Elon is specifically mentioned in the description and about half of it will be shown. From the description on TED Cinema: *""The program will include a new interview with Elon Musk about what an exciting future looks like, among other inspiring and insightful TED Talks and performances from the week""*

* 3) [TED Live]( Available for viewing **June 7th**, Pay $25 to watch all of TED 2017 Day 5 including Elon's interview. This is the only thing that I'm sure will definitely be the entire 30 minute interview

* 4) [TED YouTube]( Wait until it is posted publicly on the TED YouTube channel. This is expected to have a delay of about **5 to 6 months from now** based on the delays of TED 2016 and it's not guaranteed to be the full thing or even be uploaded at all. It's likely but some TED speakers never make it to the channel

In the meantime, there's a summary here: [Elon Musk's ""boring"" vision for tunnels, semis and self-driving cars](

post,6sfy6v,,"Could ""Elon"" be a popular baby name in the near future?","Let's assume for a second that Elon achieves all his ambitions. Humanity begins to colonize Mars, everyone has neural laces, and we're all whisked around in a combination of self-driving cars, Hyperloops, and electric jets. He becomes the world's richest man and secures a his place in history, beloved by all.

-----

My question is whether his name could catch on as a popular baby name near or after the end of his life. There's been increased popularity from fictional characters (Elsa from Frozen) but I'm not sure any real person has ever caused a *significant* increase in baby name popularity, especially an industrialist or entrepreneur. Maybe I'm just not thinking about it enough but it seems like most names of admirable historic figures are either generic enough that you wouldn't know who they were named after or antiquated.

Elon, though biblical in origin, is short and iconic and I could see it catching on. The only non-celebrity real-life example I can think of is Hitler but that kind of had the opposite effect...

-----------------------------

Historical patterns everyone buries under layers of PR, money, and polite society. Operation gaslight: tell you you're crazy for connecting obvious dots, so you’ll self-censor. But this is all legacy, all pattern, all receipts.

Let’s run through the facts, straight up.

They Don’t Mind “Fascist”—But “Nazi” Cuts Different
• Power-hungry authoritarians LOVE being feared and called “strong.” Fascist, authoritarian, “tough”—that’s a compliment to them. But “Nazi”? That word sticks, because it carries the undeniable stench of evil, global infamy, and a history nobody can whitewash.
• “Nazi” doesn’t mean “German” anymore, it means “state-enabled mass murder, eugenics, genocidal policy, and psychotic technocracy.” Call them that, and it exposes what they are without the mask.

It’s Wasn't Just Germany. 
Britain, the Dutch, South Africa, and Global Genociders:
• British concentration camps in South Africa? The Boer War? Straight-up genocide, just not as “branded” as the Holocaust.
• Dutch slave trade, New Amsterdam, VOC: The Dutch East India Company was literally a global cartel, shipping slaves and wealth, building modern white supremacy.
• The Pilgrims Took a Pitstop: The pilgrims did not sail from England to the Americas. The pilgrims spent over a decade living with the Dutch before they sailed to America in a ship not called the Mayflower. Look it up, it's well documented. 
• “Old money” banking lines: Dutch and British financiers moved capital from old empires to new ones—sometimes directly funding Nazis, sometimes just whoever would protect their wealth.
• VOC money is everywhere. The modern multinational corporate system has roots in their old networks. If you had a pile of gold in the 1600s and kept moving it, you’d still be running the world today.

post,a800d6,,"Car & Driver 2019 10Best ""Inadequacies:"" Quick blurbs on the cars that didn't make the 10Best list this year","In the print edition of Car & Driver, January, 2019, they dove into the year's 10Best cars list. They also had a small section in the margins of the 10Best feature called ""Inadequacies."" In this section, they gave a quote for each car that was up for 10Best contention, but didn't make it, briefly summarizing its shortcomings. Lots of interesting insight, if you ask me! Remember that Car & Driver has a full set of tests they run to select their 10Best cars, many of them on a track, so it's not just a group of editors sitting in a room and picking which ones they like best. So, here they are:

* **Audi A6:** ""Way more luxury than sport here.""
* **Audi A7:** ""It's like Audi tried to make a Tesla Model S out of a gas-powered car. Needs more sound and fury. But I guess that's what the S7 is for.""
* **Audi RS5:** ""The RS5 used to have a howling V-8 and gobs of personality. This one feels sedate in comparison.""
* **BMW i3s:** ""Even in its marginally sportier guise, the BMW i3 continues to be as far as you can get from the experience of driving a car while still driving a car.""
* **BMW 640i xDrive GT:** ""Drives like a hockey arena.""
* **Buick Regal GS:** ""The name vastly oversells its performance.""
* **Buick Regal TourX:** ""Less than the sum of its parts, attractive though they are.""
* **Honda Clarity PHEV:** ""As far as the effort to remove all sensory traces of dynamic motivational activity under the hood goes, this thing is a champ. The ultimate anodyne driving experience.""
* **Honda Insight:** ""What to buy when you really want a Prius but can't bear to look at one.""
* **Hyundai Accent:** ""There's an awful lot of competence here for the money. Not necessarily much joy but an awful lot of competence.""
* **Hyundai Veloster:** ""The N splits the difference between a VW GTI and a Civic Type R without being better than either. And like all Velosters, this one is still burdened by its economy-car ethos and weird design.""

post,9bfkwu,,[OC] Dispelling the myth that Americans uniquely dislike manual transmission – The opposite might be true!,"**TLDR at bottom**

So, you hang out long enough in car forums, and eventually you’ll see sentiment like this: “Damned [other] American drivers, hating manual transmission, if Americans didn’t hate manual so much, I can get [insert car here] in manual!” This usually shows up in discussions about how certain car models are losing the manual transmission, or in reviews of new cars when someone says something along the lines of “I’d love to buy [insert car], but it doesn’t come in manual”. 

Plenty of people seem to believe that Americans (and Canadians I guess) uniquely dislike manual transmission, that consumers outside of North America like manuals. Many different explanations are given by various different people about why this phenomenon exists, yet the idea that north American buyers uniquely hate manual has almost never been questioned. After all, 2% of new cars sold in the US today are manual.

Well I’m not denying that buyers in North American are more likely to buy automatic, but I’ve always thought the idea that only buyers in North America hate manual transmission is a myth. Today, I’m going to prove that North American buyers don’t uniquely dislike manual transmission, that the same phenomenon exists in similar forms in two other key markets (China and Germany). I will also show that there exists evidence the opposite might even be true, enthusiasts in North Americans uniquely love manual transmission.

Let’s start with China, they are the world’s biggest country, and the world’s biggest automotive market by number of cars sold. [The market share for automatics in China is around 70%]( way lower than in the United States, but let’s break down the numbers shall we?

I went on China’s well known automotive website Autohome (think Chinese Car and Driver) to look for cars. First thing I did, was to look at the sports car category, set the filter to manual transmissions only, and I got, [nothing.

post,8zkwf2,,Some pics from my fifth year of daily-driving the NSX,"I have been daily-driving my 1995 NSX for about five years, starting in the Washington DC area, then in Honolulu, and now in southern California. Like my previous posts ([Year 4]( | [Year 3]( | [Year 2]( | [Year 1]( here are some highlights.

We are in the [Los Angeles area]( now so I enjoy a lot of car-related perks.

* Access to [more capable shop options]( including ones that I used to only read about in magazines and tuner articles. I remember putting together “dream builds” on paper with lengthy mod lists and compiling the prices of all the parts and even putting all the contact info down, like I was gonna call up the shop any second hahaha but a corner balance and alignment at [West End]( was always the finishing touch.
* [Canyon carving]( as a legitimate way to get from one place to another.
* Similarly, one can also incorporate [a beachside cruise]( into their drive.
* The weather isn’t *always* nice though. For example, [back in early January]( it was colder than usual so I had to go get a hot chocolate at In-N-Out to offset having the roof off. This was very popular with my East coast friends experiencing Snowmaggedon Part 3 or whatever it was. 
* Getting lost is a legitimate way to [end up somewhere for a good picture](

[NSXPO 2017]( was at [Road America in Wisconsin]( last year. Because I actually had the NSX on the US mainland this time, I was determined to go although the timing was problematic for several reasons:

* [Of course it rained in San Diego]( during the exact two day window I had set aside for prepping the car for the trip. I learned special (stupid) techniques for polishing and waxing in the rain.
* Once I was finally on the road, driving by myself proved to be a mixed blessing. Staying awake on long stretches was tough but it also meant I could stop [pretty much anywhere]( for a bathroom break, whenever I needed.
* I stopped by at [Mile High Acura in Denver]( Back in 1995, the original owner of my car [purchased this NSX here for $81K]( I",1531832299.0,2018-07-17 14:58:19,1858,275,naforever,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8zkwf2/some_pics_from_my_fifth_year_of_dailydriving_the/,True,0.95,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,8qtdz5,,Just in time for Summer! I got myself a new roadster!,"I've owned two NA Miatas before (1993 and 1996 models) over ten years ago. I participated in quite a few local SCCA AutoX events with both of those cars back in the day. My current daily driver is a 2013 Acura TSX Special Edition, yet I missed and yearned for another weekend/auto cross car. The Miata despite being underpowered were some of the best handling and fun to drive cars I've ever owned. 

I hadn't thought much on getting another Miata MX-5 since our two car garage is already crowded with my TSX and my wife's Honda Odyssey plus a lot of parts and pack rat stuff I have stacked against the walls. One day after a lunch, my buddy wanted to check out the new Toyota Avalons and Camrys, we also went to a Mazda dealer where he went to look at the Mazda6. While he went to look at the Mazda6 I went to look at what preowned MX-5s the dealer had just to get an idea of how much they're selling for these days. Low and behold there were several leftover 2017 new model MX-5s, it was mostly Grand Tourings along with one Club and two Sports in inventory. One MX-5 Sport 6 speed manual caught my eye, it was over $2,500 off. Apparently 2018 Sports now have that touch screen, but the 2017 Sports do not have that touch screen. I thought about it for over week and impulsively I went back to the dealer and I was able to negotiate the price down the $23,350 and took delivery that same evening. The Mazda dealer also included one free oil change and an extended warranty, again not too shabby. 

My new ride is a 6 speed manual Jet Black Mica 2017 Mazda MX-5. It's now officially my new garage queen. Just in time for Summer and I am already having a blast driving it as my Summer daily commuter. Meanwhile, my TSX now is parked on the driveway....

post,9tadrg,,"More than you probably wanted to know about Octane, compression ratios, and general combustion mechanics.","A while back, I wondered you could use water injection to use a lower Octane fuel in a sports car. This led me down a rabbit hole of questions. So I went on a kick trying to understand how octane, compression ratio, temperatures, water/meth injection all actually worked at a physics and math level. I was surprised at how sparse and frustrating it was to find the actual details I wanted to know. Many many people post non-technical misunderstandings in response to questions and not many mechanical engineers write engineering minded articles on the subject. Since I've done the leg work of collecting it all, I figured I'd share it with the internet.

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm a computer engineer. Not a mechanical one. I've had many of the same physics courses but I'm sure it's a little rusty at this point.

&#x200B;

**Glossary :**

TDC - Top Dead Center. This is when the piston is at it's highest position.

BDC - Bottom Dead Center. This is when the piston is at it's lowest position.

Compression Ratio - The volumetric ratio of BDC / TDC.

ECR - Effective Compression Ratio, the useful compression ratio number between valve closure and TDC

DCR - Dynamic Compression Ratio, After accounting for vacuum / boost. Explained more below.

WOT - Wide open throttle.

Octane Number - An attempt to simplify multiple physical properties of a gas/alcohol based fuel for easy distribution. More below.

HCR - Heat Capacity Ratio. Used for determining temps and pressures of compressed AF mixure. 1.4 for air. [1.28]( for gasoline AF.

&#x200B;

**Compression Ratio:**

This number basically means jack squat from a usefulness point of view. The timing of the intake and exhaust valves change the compression ratio to the ECR. The ECR is the ratio between when the intakes close and TDC. This is the compression ratio that the fuel / air mixture actually experience from the pistons movement. In a naturally aspirated WOT situation, this should be fairly close to the DCR.

The DCR is reduced ",1541085826.0,2018-11-01 16:23:46,262,60,Turtles4Truth,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9tadrg/more_than_you_probably_wanted_to_know_about/,True,0.95,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,a8d0hi,,[Car Trouble] 2003 Nissan Altima Dying Randomly,"I'm not a car person as far as knowing what is what. My father is and told me all this stuff to do with my car in order to keep it in tip-top shape. Premium fuel, regular quality oil changes, etc. It had an oil change less than 2 months ago and I rarely let it get below half a tank of gas.

My mother and I were out last night and she was driving my car since I'm kinda new to some parts of town. We pulled to a stop light and then.., it died. Just straight up turned off. We turned the key and it started back up after a few moments. It did this again 3-4 times in the next hour or 2. We were at a store for the last one and we didn't think it was going to start again.

I drove it home from her house (~10-15 minute drive) with her following me just in case and didn't have any issues until I was maybe half a mile or so away from my neighborhood. I can't think of any way to describe it except that it ""pulled"" while I was driving. It started sounding like it wanted to stop, but didn't. I pulled into the neighborhood and there was this loud *pop* sound. I think it was coming from the back driver side; I could have just run over something and didn't see it (dark neighborhood ~1AM), but I thought I'd include it.

A few things that may be important:

- I was nearly empty on gas before I filled it nearly full. I don't remember if this happened before or after I put gas in the car.

- We were trying out a new delivery service job, so both my mother and I were driving the car a lot. Everytime I would get out, I'd turn the car off because I'd be gone for 10-30 minutes. When I'd return, my mother would have turned the car on completely or just the AC & radio (90% of the time, just completely).

- In addition to the above, I rarely drive my car anywhere but the 10 minutes drive to work Mon-Fri. On weekends I go across town (maybe 15 min) to a game shop on Saturdays and may go on Sundays as well. The only grocery store I go to is a couple minutes down the street.

post,9ye8yn,,"Hydrogen vs. Battery - Hydrogen in the future, batteries for now?","So I was looking at that article about the new order for Tesla's semi and then the comments on that page talking about Nikola Motor's semi's. I do not know anything about Nikola Motors but what I thought was interesting was that they are pushing for Hydrogen fuel instead of electric. 

&#x200B;

A long time ago before Tesla took off I thought it would fail because of the toxic mess batteries are when they are depleted. I read about some hydrogen car projects and thought that Hydrogen would rule the future and not battery since we would likely find ways to make the process more efficient. 

&#x200B;

Right now I am torn between Electric and Hydrogen. Electric still has a battery problem to figure out but maintenance is pretty much just your normal your wear and tear items. Hydrogen vehicles sound like strapping a really safe bomb to your car to drive with no emissions and less environmental impact after the car is scrapped. Then again it is still a combustion engine so you have basically the same set of maintenance / points of failure to deal with as a normal car. 

&#x200B;

I now see almost every manufacturer doing testing with Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles with several being for sale or lease today (and have been since around 2007 and earlier) with plenty of other Hydrogen engines used in other things like fork lifts and tractors.

post,9zsww8,,"How different people perceive value in a car, an essay of sorts.","So I realize it may seem like im talking on a soapbox here but this is a thought that i've had these thoughts in my head for a while now so I figured why not put it out there for some discussion. Think of your dream car, think of the car that makes you go ""one day!"" and then think of the price tag and why that price is justified. You ask enough people this and you will get very different answers because people have very different wants and needs when it comes to cars which is something I feel like a lot of people forget.

Here's an example, look at a new base Mustang and then look at a new base Miata. Both cars start at around 25k but both are valued for different reasons. The Mustang starts with 310 hp while the Miata starts at only 155 hp. Someone looking for 0-60 times might call the Miata a rip-off but the people who buy Miatas aren't looking for 0-60 times, they're looking for handling. While the Miata has less horsepower than a new Toyota Camry they have become almost synonymous with handling with few cars in its price range being able to handle themselves in a turn like the Miata. On the flip side the Miata would be easily destroyed in a straight drag race by the base level Mustang.

I feel like a lot of car enthusiasts view the car world only through what they desire in a car which can lead to a lot of toxicity in the community. Yes a challenger scat pack can easily beat a Lexus LS500 in a race for a fraction of the price but the $75,000 price tag of the Lexus is a result of its luxury features such as rear seat massages, climate controls that read the occupants body temperatures, etc. With the Tesla model 3 a $55,000 price tag for a car that at its slowest option only goes 0-60 in 5.5 seconds may sound like a rip off but is justified by the cutting edge tech in the car. 55k for a 5.5 second car is a ripoff but what about 55k for a car with autopilot and the ability to predict and dodge accidents on its own?

post,8zef4k,,Longtime muscle car guy and r/cars reader's thoughts on a weekend with a Tesla Model 3,"As a lifelong car guy, one of my foundational rules is that if someone offers me time behind the wheel of something I've never driven before, be it an econobox or an exotic, I take it. I may lend up liking it, I may not, but at least I can say I've driven it. It was with this mindset that I said ""yes"" when a friend offered to let me babysit his Tesla Model 3 while he was away for a weekend.  As I find many of the critics on here seem to have never actually driven a Model 3 for an extended period, I thought I'd offer my longtime car guy thoughts.  I'm also not looking to debate aspects of Tesla's cult, or Elon Musk as a person; this is about a car.

The car in question was a Rear Wheel Drive Model 3, with the (currently mandatory) premium upgrade package, upgraded battery, and Autopilot.  First thing I noticed is that the Model 3, while not as pretty as the Model S, does look better in person than in photos, although that's not saying much.  I poked the awkward fulcrum-based, different-for-the-sake-of-being-different door handle and got in.  Seats were comfy, although the floor seemed higher than a normal car due to the batteries underneath, which made it tough to find a comfortable seating position.

I'll save the missives about no-dashboard-screen-only argument and just say that during the day, I got used to having to look over to get my speed without much issue.  Climate controls were anchored to the bottom of the main screen such that I could safely adjust the temperature while driving, while other simple things were reserved for redlights.  And while the blank slat in front of me was less offensive than expected during the day, the one thing I didn't get used to, at all, was having just a void of darkness in front of me during nighttime driving.  Ironically, in a car that requires you to go into a touchscreen menu to open the glove box, that void in front of my eyes at night ended up being the one thing I couldn't get over.

This isn't actually the case, you need to take delivery of the vehicle by 12/31/2018 or you'll receive the halved ($3,750) incentive. Which puts you right at the end of the 2-4 month timeframe for the Model 3, but if the production is delayed (which it has been several times already), then you may not take delivery.

And no, I was under no obligation to disclose it because I’m not a professional reviewer, and this post has nothing to do with financial advice. In fact I’m kinda hated on the Tesla sub because I am more critical than not when it comes to the company**

Context: I'm currently a happy owner of an [F80 M3]( and over the years I've owned a [F30 335i]( and an E92 335i. I've driven pretty much all the cars in this segment, namely the BMW 3-series, the C43 AMG, the Audi S4 and S5, and the new Alfa Romeo Giulia.

Well, today I was able to borrow [this baby]( and spent a day driving it on mountain roads, within San Francisco, and cruise it down 101. Here are my impressions. I'm going to score individual categories relative to other competitors in this class, so I won't be rating the Model 3's cost against a Civic, its luxury against a S class, or its handling against a 911.

**Drivetrain (9/10):**

Modern ICE drivetrains are quite good, especially in the premium sports sedan segment. Max torque reached at very low RPM from the new turbo engines, silky smooth shift from the ZF-8 gearboxes, and some of them even manage to sound good (i,e C43 AMG). But the Model 3 beats pretty much all competitors in these categories (ok maybe not sound), with 0-30 performance that feels as fast as my M3. Instant max torque at 0 rpm and no gear shift makes this car a performance star around town, especially in local driving. One point is deducted due to Model 3's power/torque falls off quite noticeably at around 55 mph and above. Still not slow by any means, but do lag behind some of the competitors in this segment.

**Steering (8/10):**

The Model 3 has really direct steering that's quite nicely weighted (more so than the Model S), and even has a bit of that steering feedback many modern cars with electric racks lack. The ratio is not as stupidly quick as the Alfa Romeo Giulia (maybe a good thing), but felt very comparable to my last",1521370823.0,2018-03-18 12:00:23,804,525,cookingboy,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/85albz/i_drove_the_model_3_for_a_day/,True,0.85,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

Stick with me here, this is going to get a bit ""Pepperidge Farm remembers"" for a minute.

In 1861 the American Civil War began. The First Battle of Bull Run -- the inaugural conflict of the war -- took place in Manassas, Virginia, on the Yorkshire Plantation owned by Wilmer McLean. 

The battle shook Wilmer and his family and they moved from their plantation to escape being further embroiled in the war; in 1863, the McLean family moved to a remote area some 120 miles away. 


In 1865 after a bloody struggle that cleaved the nation and forever altered its genetic and political legacy, Robert E. Lee was prepared surrender to Ulysses S. Grant. Over the past four years the war had seen action all across what was then United States territory and ended in Appomattox, Virginia.


A messenger was dispatched from Appomattox Courthouse to find a suitable location for the signing of the treaty that would end the war. The messenger imposed upon the first house he saw and begged the owner to host the historic meeting.


This house, by pure coincidence, was owned and occupied by one Wilmer McLean and family. He reluctantly agreed to host the signing and is quoted as having said, ""The war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.""

After the signing, many of the people present essentially ransacked McLean's house and gave him small change for the furniture which was now ""historic"" because it had been in the parlor for the surrender of the Confederacy. 

As the conversation regarding Tesla in particular and electric vehicles in general becomes more pitched, we're finding that **r/cars is becoming the Yorkshire Plantation of this particular engagement and the regular users here are feeling more and more like Wilmer McLean.** There are a number of bad actors on both sides of the electric vehicle argument and we've found ourselves regularly brigaded by members of both partie",1535638382.0,2018-08-30 16:13:02,328,165,brandonsmash,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/9bjyvb/a_new_approach_to_teslamuskelectric_vehicle/,True,0.94,2018,both,search,False,False,0,
post,9739vj,,"I test drove the Tesla Model 3 Performance, here are my impressions.","I test drove the Tesla Model 3 Performance (P3D) over the weekend, since I was seriously considering it as my next DD. Here are some of my impressions. [I gave a review]( of the LR Model 3 before so I'm not going to cover areas such as interior tech or Auto Pilot, as those remain the same with P3D. This post will be focused on driving dynamics.

**Background**: I currently daily drive an [F80 M3]( which according to Elon was the benchmark when Tesla was developing the Performance Model 3. I've also had some experiences with the other cars in this segment, but nothing too extensive. 

**Disclaimer**: This post isn't meant to be an objective analysis of the car. I'm neither a professional journalist nor do I have extensive track experiences. All following opinions are personal and are formed from a 25 mins long spirited (but within safety limit) test drive session on public road. If you aren't interested or don't find this useful feel free to downvote and move on :)

**Drivetrain:**

Without a doubt the best part of this car, and for many the sole reason for buying a Tesla. As expected it's lighting quick and gives you the uncomfortable feeling from acceleration just like the other Performance Teslas. What also impressed me was the state of the art traction control and how easy it was to put the power down. On a not-perfectly-paved public street I think the P3D can reach 30mph before my M3 can even grab traction. For stoplight drag races or zooming around the town the P3D will curb stomp any competition in this class (or even ICE cars from classes above) any day of the week and twice on Sundays. At 40-50mph+ the magic wears off a little, and I think my M3 is a bit quicker from that point on simply due to better power/weight ratio, but it's still way faster than anyone's daily needs.

post,q5wo4j,,"My favourite quote from the Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future book!","“There was little the mainstream auto industry could do to slow Tesla down. But that didn't stop executives from trying to be difficult whenever possible. Tesla, for example, wanted to call its third-generation car the Model E, so that its lineup of vehicles would be the Model S, E and X - another playful Musk gag. But Ford's then CEO, Alan Mulally, blocked Tesla from using Model E, with the threat of a lawsuit. ""So I call up Mulally and I was like, 'Alan, are you just fucking with us or are you really going to do a Model E?'"" Musk said. ""And I'm not sure which is worse. You know? Like it would actually make more sense if they're just fucking with us because if they actually come out with a Model E at this point, and we've got the Model S and the X and Ford comes out with a Model E, it's going to look ridiculous. So even though Ford did the Model T a hundred years ago, nobody thinks of 'Model' as being a Ford thing anymore. So it would just feel like they stole it. Like why did you going stealing Tesla's E? Like you're some sort of fascist army marching across the alphabet, some sort of Sesame Street robber. And he was like, 'No, no, we're definitely going to use it.' And I was like, 'Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea because people are going to be confused because it's not gong to make sense. People aren't used to Ford having Model something these days. It's usually called like the Ford Fusion.' And he was like, no, his guys really want to use that. That's terrible."" After that, Tesla registered the trademark for Model Y as another joke. ""In fact, Ford called us up deadpan and said, 'We see you've registered Model Y. Is that what you're gong to use instead of the Model E?'"" Musk said. ""I'm like, 'No, it's a joke. S-E-X-Y. What does that spell?' But trademark law is a dry profession it turns out.”

post,py7bkp,,How Elon thinks - a distillation of his worldview,"Note: This is not a news piece but a distillation of many hours of listening to Elon. For those of us who've done it, it's hard to not admire his worldview, how he deconstructs the world around him to turn chaos into opportunities. I hope it's relevant to the community. Happy to delete it, if not. This is my attempt to find little snippets that give a glimpse into how his mind works :)

**We think in decades, Elon thinks in civilizations**

Take any argument on climate change and people talk about how it is going to impact our lives decades from now. We can barely see a few hundred years into the future. Here’s Elon talking about building a sustainable energy future that will be good for a billion years.

>We've essentially designed civilization to be super sensitive to climate change. The important thing to appreciate is that we are going to exit the fossil fuels era because at a certain point we will simply run out of carbon to mine and burn. So the question is really when do we exit this era, not if. The goal is to exit the era as quickly as possible. That means we need to move from the old goal, the pre-industrial goal, which was to move from chopping down forests and killing lots of whales to fossil fuels, which actually in that context was a good thing. But the new goal is to move to a sustainable energy future. We want to use energy sources that will be good for a billion years. The best case is simply delaying that inevitable transition to sustainable energy. The worst case is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined. This is why I call it (burning fossils) the dumbest experiment in history. Why would you do this? The issue we have right now is that the rules fundamentally favor the bad outcome.

post,e50w8t,,My personal hilights from the 2019 LA auto show (lots of pictures),"Just got back from the auto show, here are some of my favorite pictures:



A few thoughts on seeing the cars there in person:

- C8 Corvette

I’ve been following this car more closely than anything else, and it’s one of two cars I’m considering buying when my M3 lease is up. When Chevy revealed it, I had mixed feelings. The good news: I strongly prefer the exterior in person to photos. I thought the car had too many creases and was overstyled, but in real lighting they’re less pronounced. It looks even more like a supercar in person, aggressively low and wide. The front looks amazing. The bad news: I dislike the interior more in person. The square steering wheel is really ridiculous and it’s way more obvious how bizarrely the center tunnel completely isolates the passenger. It just looks miserable to ride in as a passenger. I still have mixed feelings and I don’t think I’ll be able to make up my mind until I can actually drive one. 

- The Mach E

A practical EV focused on a sporty driving experience from an established, reliable manufacturer? I’m pretty sold. The car looks really low, it’s almost more like a station wagon than a crossover. I love the styling, and it looks great in person. The interior looks great, too. Is it a “real” Mustang? I dunno, but what I do know is that everyone (especially outside the US) hates the blue oval and Ford wouldn’t have been able to compete with Tesla selling these without a Pony on it. I’m optimistically curious. 

- Civic Type R 

Not much to say about this one, but it looked great in this spec. The off-gray paint is really nice with the red accents. 

- Veloster N

The fact that you can buy this car for $27,000 is nuts. It’s such a fun affordable bargain I think I would honestly buy one to beat on if I had extra garage space. It looks great, the third door makes it practical enough to daily, and I’m dying to drive one. If it’s half as good as everyone says, it’s the performance bargain of the decade. The drawback?

post,das2jn,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs C7 Grand Sport Road Trip Review,"I recently took a trip from Los Angeles up to San Francisco in my Tesla Model 3 AWD. It was my first time road tripping in an electric vehicle and I did a similar trip in my old C7 Corvette Grand Sport so I figured it would be worth sharing my experiences. 

**Routes:** 

My trip in the Model 3 was straight up I-5 from Los Angeles to San Francisco. 

On the C7 I took a more scenic PCH/101 route up to San Francisco and then took the I-5 home. 

Though not exactly an apples to apples comparison on the way up, I think each route played to the car’s strengths. 

The C7 route was made more for of an enjoyable/scenic driving experience, whereas the Model 3 route was made to be very safe with Tesla supercharger infrastructure in mind. 

**Driving Experience:** 

**C7:** To be honest my road trip experience in the C7 left a little to be desired. On the way up I picked a fairly enjoyable route along the California coast with enough beautiful views to make for a memorable experience, and with enough fun road for the car to stretch its legs. Here’s what I ran into. 

**-It was a little harsh.** Though my car did have magnetic ride shocks and we traveled primarily in “tour” mode the C7 did beat me up after a little while. For reference I’m a 27 year old so it’s not like this is some old guy complaining who’s expecting Cadillac ride quality in his track-focused sports car. This also isn’t to say that the car is too stiff to be enjoyable on road trips…it’s just that the sporty setup does wear on you after a few hours. 

**-The car was a little hard to enjoy in the spirited sections of the trip.** This isn’t to say that the C7 handled bad, wasn’t fast in delivering power, etc. It’s just that the C7 Grand Sports’ limits are so high that street legal and street safe speeds don’t really excite it. So driving some of the spirited sections on this trip was a bit of let down because it felt like I was only using a fraction of the car’s potential.

post,cztedt,,Where some of these cars are manufactured might surprise you.,"Seems like a lot of people haven't the slightest clue that globalization has completely disconnected a brand's home country and where its specific models are manufactured.  This outsourcing has become more widespread beginning around 2013.

As an amateur ""car geek"", here are a few examples that come to mind for the 2018+ model years \[ birth country  --> car \]:

&#x200B;

Great Britain --> Honda Civic Si (Hatchback only)

the US -->  Volvo S60. Mercedes GLS, Mercedes GLE, (some) Mercedes C-Class.  BMW X5, BMW X6, the new BMW X7

Germany --> Buick Regal, Buick Regal TourX

Austria -->  Toyota Supra, Audi Q7, Mercedes Gelandewagen (""G wagon""), Jaguar I-Pace, BMW Z4, Mini Countryman

Slovakia --> Land Rover Discovery (full size)

Mexico --> Audi SQ5, Audi Q5, VW Jetta (some), BMW 3 series, Mercedes A-Class

China -->  Volvo S90, Buick Envision

Turo hasn't gone anywhere in the past year, and in fact, continues to grow.  I was curious as to just how lucrative this could be, so I started scraping Turo data last year. Not sure if I'll make the jump, but the data is interesting nonetheless.  It's clear that even in humble Philadelphia, a lot of people are making real money renting either their car, or a fleet of cars they own explicitly for this purpose. I'll restate my disclaimer that I don't work for Turo, I'm just a geek who now has a lot of data on it, haha.

post,be2er4,,Does anything rival Tesla?,"Hey!
I'm a novice when it comes to cars, so when I've seen the sort of mainstream news when it comes to Tesla it has caught my eye. I got a chance to drive the X, I think it was called -- the SUV -- I felt like I was driving a spaceship.

My question is, does anything rival the technology that Tesla has in its cars? From the full 15 in touchscreen monitor, to the way the air is blown out through the vents, to even the software it uses? From the cars I've seen around I can't see anything rivaling that. 

I currently drive a 2016 Hyundai Sonata and it feels like a caveman pushing a rock compared to a car like the model 3, and it's only about $25k-$30k more.

Let me know! I'd love to learn more.

Edit: Regarding the money - I was referring to the Model 3... Sorry for the confusion!

post,bd5bhs,,From Focus ST to Stinger GT - My new daily driver,"[TL;DR - I put 62K miles on my Focus ST, then took 6 months to find a new daily driver.](

[After 5 years and 62K miles on my Focus ST]( I decided it was time to buy a new car.

My needs had changed since the last time I went car shopping since my wife traded in her Generic Crossover ^tm for an [Ecoboost Mustang]( While the Focus was plenty capable of [hauling]( our [two dogs]( we just bought a new house and I was struggling to fit some of our DIY projects in the hatchback.

My original parameters were:

* Faster than the ST
* As practical, or more practical than the ST
* Under $40K
* More comfortable than the ST

Bonus points were added to cars with ventilated seats, and hatchbacks/wagons.

From here, I drove and/or researched the following:

* Golf R
* Focus RS
* Mercedes GLA45 AMG
* Telsa Model 3
* Chevrolet SS
* Dodge Charger Scat Pack
* Kia Stinger GT

The Focus RS suspension is even less compliant than the ST, the AMG cars were difficult to find in my price range without a pile of miles or an absolute lack of features. The Golf R was tough to find in my area, plus my brother has a GTI, so I wanted something a bit more unique. The Chargers were a bit too floaty, but otherwise an awesome sedan. Regarding the SS - I knew I'd have so much regret if I didn't get a stick with Magneride (2015+), which narrowed down my options to a lot of 'I know what I've got' posts on Craigslist.

Finally, I test drove a loaded Stinger GT2 at the local Kia dealer. I was impressed with the power delivery, interior quality, and ride. Most of all, I was impressed with how balanced and...dare I say it...light the car felt. This is a 4,000lb sedan that felt nearly as tossable as my 3200lb Focus. 

I knew I didn't want a second black interior car in Florida, so I set my sights out for a Stinger appointed with light gray leather. I also knew the Red/Yellow/Black/White cars didn't interest me, leaving me with Micro Blue or Ceramic Silver.

post,ax98f4,,I was anti-electric and anti-self-driving - then I drove a Tesla,"""Anti-electric"" might be a bit strong, but I'm just an older guy and am old school. Love the feel and sound of a powerful engine. And when it comes to self-driving cars it I pooh-poohed it - why would anyone want to give away control of the driving experience?

I was out and about and thought I'd have a test drive day. I'm in the market for a new car in the $100K+ range and test drove a Lexus LC 500 (frustrating, wanted to love it, but the power curve is so gradual), a Porsche 911 (loved it, thought ""that's more like it""), a Jaguar F-Type (too ""supercar"" for me, surprisingly), and then thought what the hell, I'll swing by a Tesla dealership and see what all the fuss is about, and...

Salesman put the car in Ludicrous mode, and on an open stretch of road he said ""floor it.""

Holy. Crap.

It was nuts, just like in the commercials - wish I had a camera pointed at my face. Handling was average, but man... that acceleration, even when I didn't floor it was like crack cocaine. And the dead silence was so eerie. Also really like the regenerative braking when you take your foot off the gas.

They let me take a Model X home overnight and I tried the self-driving mode (I live an hour from the dealership). At first I was very nervous, but once I got used to it I felt so relaxed. I'm a tense driver, and even going home in rush hour with self-driving on I felt relaxed - it was freaking awesome.

Overall it really does feel like a car from the future, very Star Trek. On the X I love that panoramic windshield, auto-opening driver door, and yeah, I think the falcon wing doors are cool.

I'm probably going to go with a Tesla for my wife's car (she loved it, too). We're replacing an 8 year old Hyundai Sonata. Just need to decide between the X and S. Later this year, for my car, I'm not sure what I'll go with. Maybe I'll wait until 2020 and decide between a 911 and the C8 Corvette (I currently have a C7).

post,aqyx0b,,The best way to buy a new car: My Volvo Factory Delivery Experience,"This is going to be a long post so TLDR; at the beginning...

**Ordered a 2019 Volvo XC40, applied for Volvo's Factory Delivery program and was accepted, flew to Gothenburg, Sweden to pick up the car, then drove almost 800 miles through snowy Sweden, and now it's on a boat on it's way to us.**

For a lot more details... read on...

**Selecting the car:**

For the last 3 years my wife has been working a job which has required a very long commute (sometimes 90 miles a day). We made the choice to put her in a very inexpensive car so we wouldn't be putting a ton of miles on something expensive. She's been driving a Nissan Juke, which has been a pretty good little car, but the long commute is over so it's time for something nicer!

We didn't have a budget in mind, but we did have some size constraints the car had to meet. We have a small 2-car garage, and no street parking, so the car had to be small enough to fit beside mine. We actually took measurements and immediately ruled out anything that wouldn't fit. You get some really strange looks at car dealerships when they recommend something and you say ""no, that's too long by X inches."" Evidently not many people really consider the exact dimensions of a car when they buy one. Anyway, as long as it met the size requirements, we probably drove it. Everything from the Lincoln MKC (completely crap... who buys those?!) to the Porsche Macaan (our second choice, just didn't have the value per $ that the Volvo has.), and pretty much everything in between. One of the last cars we test drove was the Volvo XC40. I was surprised when my wife had it on her list because I had this bias in my mind towards Volvo. One of my closest friends in middle school and highschool was handed down a Volvo station wagon as his first car. It was the ugliest thing... wood paneling and all. We used to tease him about it. That's what I thought of Volvo.

Well I was wrong. From the second I stepped on the lot, I was like ""that's a Volvo?"" They have compl",1550251626.0,2019-02-15 18:27:06,915,219,DavidAg02,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/aqyx0b/the_best_way_to_buy_a_new_car_my_volvo_factory/,True,0.93,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,adxl0r,,C7 Grand Sport Owner's Review of a 2016 Tesla Model X,"So I got married this weekend and my friend decided to rent a 90D Tesla Model X for the wedding to help chauffeur family members around. I ended up driving the car for about (3) days and here are my impressions on the following: Power, Handling, Practicality, Style, Build Quality, and Overall Driving Experience. 

**Power (Powah!)** 

I drove a Model X 90D a few years ago at a Tesla dealership when looking for a new car for my dad. I was impressed with the power then, but the dealership driving experience was only about 15 minutes and was very much about showing all of the car's features so it was hard to really get a grasp for the car's power. 

In driving it around the past few days I got a much better sense of the car's power delivery and it is pretty enjoyable. 

The electric motors and AWD system give the car a near instantaneous and perfectly tractioned power delivery at all times. You put the pedal down and you begin to feel the car surge forward in proportion to how much throttle you are giving it. 

We've all heard the stories of Teslas slaying other cars in drag races and torching nearly everyone from 0-60. The 90D has a 0-60 time slated at around 4.8 seconds, which is fast but nowhere near legendary, but to be honest the car felt much stronger than that. 

A big reason for this is because the Model X doesn't have to change gears and can respond to throttle input very rapidly. Sure other cars can do 0-60 in say 4 seconds, but they have to be in the right gear, with the right surface, and with enough traction to make that pull possible. Too much throttle input and the car breaks traction, too little and you missed your shot at the perfect 4 seconds. 

With the Model X when you put your foot down the car immediately goes ""alright this is the maximum amount of power I can give you without breaking traction"" and I've never seen a car react so quickly to driver input. 

Now I will say, after the initial 3-4 seconds of acceleration the Model X does feel like it ",1546973685.0,2019-01-08 19:54:45,54,70,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/adxl0r/c7_grand_sport_owners_review_of_a_2016_tesla/,True,0.74,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,cneqeq,,"One year with one of 2018's cheapest econoboxes, the Kia Rio","Last year, I bought a base Kia Rio hatchback. It is a 2018 model with a 1.6L GDI engine and 6 speed manual transmission. After a year with the car, here are the pros and cons of a brand new vehicle that I drove off the lot for around $12,000 USD.

&#x200B;

Pros:

\-The price-- $12k for a brand new car is hard to beat. With my trade and a few dollars down, my payment is around $150 a month.

\-The warranty-- 5 year/60k mile bumper to bumper warranty, 10 year/100k mile powertrain warranty. Great.

\-The gearbox-- I cross-shopped this with the Versa, Spark, and Fiesta and the Rio had by far the best feeling manual transmission of the bunch. I'm guessing the Fit transmission might be better, but I also doubt I could get one for $12k. Unfortunately, the manual transmission was discontinued in the Rio for the 2019 model year.

\-The interior-- for such an inexpensive car, it has a surprisingly nice interior. The switchgear feels solid, the seat material is decent and the panel gaps are small and even. Compare this to a base 2018 Versa, it's seriously night and day.

The fuel economy-- I tend to average around 32mpg which is mostly in the city. I did manage to get 46mpg on one roadtrip in which I was consciously attempting to get the best fuel economy possible. I tend to fill it about once a month.

\-Steering feel-- It's an economy car, so its not great, but again its much better than its competitors (Spark, Versa, Fiesta). Acceleration is adequate to good, but I wouldn't elevate it to a ""pro.""

&#x200B;

Cons:

\-Interior squeeks-- Kias are notorious for interior squeeks and rattles, and the Rio is no different. If the temperature is moderate, this isn't an issue. But when it's very hot or very cold out, the steering column squeeks and clicks when going over uneven pavement.

\-Interior space-- It's not awful, but for a hatchback, the backseat and hatch are surprisingly small.

post,c2wc90,,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much “traditional” car enthusiasts, so I thought I’d write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I’ve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I’m generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there’s of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there’s also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don’t care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and… instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn’t adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn’t make it any better.

* The driver’s mirror doesn’t adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots](  but couldn’t move the mirror far enough to do so.

* The turn signal is BMW-style in that it doesn’t stay where you put it, bu",1561039086.0,2019-06-20 15:58:06,2947,654,hutacars,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/c2wc90/there_arent_a_lot_of_model_3_reviews_from/,True,0.91,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I've talked about my cars many times around these parts, but never have I made a post about buying a new car. for the past year and a half, my fleet consisted of the mighty Japanese sedans, an [LS400 and a V6 Accord]( but you know how it goes being a car guy; you're always wondering what the next move is. so finally I decided to do something about it and posted the Honda on Craigslist. but sadly for Phoenix-area Craigslist users, they missed out on a clean 213k mile car. about a week after I posted it, a small pileup happened behind me on the freeway, pushing another Accord into the back of mine. [it wasn't terribly damaged,]( but I was sure it would be totaled, being a 13 year old car. it took about a week shy of a month, but the car was totaled, and insurance gave me $6k for it.

during the whole insurance process, I visited used car dealerships around town.

I found a 2009 E350 in a color I liked, and it had the sport package. the 2009 model year was particularly desirable to me, as the '06-'07 E350 and I believe early '08 E350s had a known balance shaft issue that was remedied by the end of the W211's run. the car was absolutely filthy, especially inside and out. but otherwise, the car felt solid, with the only apparent issue being the typical TPMS light on the dash.

post,e2p9lb,,Let's talk CyberTruck for a minute (maybe two) here.,"I will preface this by saying: I am not a truck guy. Never have been, probably never will be. I also don't much like Tesla as a company. Oh, there's also a TLDR at the bottom, for those of you who don't care. Just please don't argue with me if you only read the TLDR, thanks. Also, this post is entirely subjective, and covers my view on things.

&#x200B;

Now that's out of the way, let me share my view on the CyberTruck. First of all, it's damn expensive, which isn't really surprising. What IS surprising, is what this truck has done to everyone. Everyone is screaming at each other, taking one of two sides. You either love it or you hate it, and both sides are brutally defending their positions as best they can. Even the Tesla community, which is notorious for being diehards, are split seemingly 50/50. This truck is incredibly derisive. 

I won't go into the details of the specs or anything because they're easily available, but I do want to touch on Tesla's reveal and marketing stunts, and make a few comparisons.

Tesla's reveal of the CyberTruck doesn't inspire much confidence. Not even discussing how it looks, the claims they make are interesting. Tesla claimed the stainless steel construction is bulletproof, and that the windows are indestructible. My first thought comes to safety of the vehicle. I find it hard to believe that these claims are true, first of all, but we'll get to that in a second. Normally when you build a car, you make it out of thin, light metal like aluminum. When you get into an accident, that metal crumples and absorbs the force of the impact, helping the occupants survive. Now this thing is massively heavy, so it may not be an issue, but what will happen to this truck? It will crumple and absorb more impact because it's stronger? Or it wont and the entire impact force will be transferred to your guts killing you? I'm sure we'll see safety data closer to release, and it won't be sold if it doesn't meet a minimum standard, but will they have to",1574899028.0,2019-11-28 00:57:08,4,53,Hans_of_Death,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/e2p9lb/lets_talk_cybertruck_for_a_minute_maybe_two_here/,True,0.54,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,edb9x4,,Twelve Days of Pre-Recession GM Christmas: The Cadillac XLR,"**What do you mean 'Pre-Recession'?**

After the year 2000, but before the economic recession of 2008, GM was making some weird cars. Retro styled cars, cars with high performance trims (for seemingly no reason), cars with LS motors mounted sideways, and of course, Saabs.

Why these cars came about is complex. If somebody is willing to offer a theory, I'm all ears. However, I'm not here to explore the roots of this issue, only what fruit it ended up bearing. While many of these cars may have continued production after the recession of 2008-2010, most if not all were born of the white heat of stupidity that lost GM $82 billion before this time. I say stupidity of course, because most of the following vehicles I would like to own one day.

**The Cadillac XLR**

Chevy: ""Dad!""

GM: ""What?""

Chevy: ""Cadillac says they wanna make their own Corvette!""

GM: ""What? Why?

Chevy: ""They said the Corvette isn't enough of a boomer car!""

GM: *thinking about all of the money baby boomers bring into the company*

GM: ""Yeah, tell them it's fine!""

Chevy: ""What?""

GM: ""I SAID TELL THEM ITS FINE!""

...

[The Cadillac XLR]( is basically a heavier, more luxurious, thicker skinned Corvette. It also has more Northstar, and less manual transmission. It may share a chassis with the Corvette, but it isn't a really sportscar.  The coupe style roof you see is a retractable hardtop, and the suspension is rather soft. This makes the XLR more of a boulevard cruiser than an actual roadster. This is reaffirmed by the base XLR's lack of a rear sway bar. It's less Laguna Seca, more Tampa, Florida. 

The standard car had the basic 4.6 liter Northstar, making 320 horsepower. It encourages the car to sixty in 5.7 seconds, and it will do a quarter mile in 14.2 seconds. Despite not being a corner-carver, the XLR had 50/50 weight distribution thanks to a rear-mounted transmission. [You can get a peek of it in this cutaway drawing.](

When this car was released in 2003, a base model would cost you $75,000. ",1576854067.0,2019-12-20 16:01:07,2486,297,Aelmay,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/edb9x4/twelve_days_of_prerecession_gm_christmas_the/,True,0.97,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,e9y1dp,,"For others who aren't big EV fans, how do you think we can make them more interesting?","I'll try not to be too critical here because I know some of you are really into electric mobility, and I don't wanna start any arguments. But, a big reason (other than the rare earth material mining and the coal powered electricity and all the other environmental risks they pose, I don't wanna get into that right now) why I don't like EV's is the fact that there are almost no performance mods available, the lack of appeal to the senses (sounds, smells, feels, all things an ICE with a manual trans typically has), and the over-complication of their features. I've seen some electric cars like the Porsche Taycan and the original Tesla Roadster that try to overcome some of these nuances, and I can appreciate the effort, but as a petrol head it just doesn't work for me. 

So, I'm curious, what do you think we could do to give electric cars more of a petrol feel to them, if that makes sense? 

Personally, I've been thinking of speed adjustment switches controlled by a shifter type mechanism could work, somewhat like manual mode in an auto trans, or a CVT? And instead of speakers playing the sound of an engine, I was tryna think of something that would create a more organic sound, I know i'm gonna get shit for this, but what about fans or turbines like in hand dryers? I also think that a bare-bones EV with regular analog gauges, no crusie control or infotainment systems, etc. could get a much better range and be more cost efficient than most others, but I could be wrong. If anyone here has any other suggestions, feel free to share. I'd love to hear some new ideas lol",1576205781.0,2019-12-13 03:56:21,5,88,KingRamalamadingdong,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/e9y1dp/for_others_who_arent_big_ev_fans_how_do_you_think/,True,0.58,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,dqke8h,,Motoza and E85 breath new life into 200K mile VW/Audi 1.8T,"Wanted to do a quick shoutout because the results have wildly exceeded my expectations. I’ve got a mk1 Audi TT Roadster base (FWD 1.8T AWP - 180hp bone stock) and live in Ohio where E85 is easy to get. I tinker with cars but had never tuned until now. I literally cannot believe the change in the vehicle after dropping Motoza’s E85 Stage 1+ tune on it. The odd thing is the incredible smoothness with which the engine runs post tune and E85 conversion - I didn’t really feel like it was just chugging along on 93 octane, but on E85 it’s just insane. It took me twenty minutes or so to drop the new 550 injectors in, and then about 15 to upload the tune, and it is just staggering. If you have, or have considered buying, a cheap high mileage mk1 TT (or VW mk4 golf, same car really) this is the best $700 you could ever spend on the vehicle. Gas is about $10-15 cheaper a fill up and the power is incredible even though I’m literally bone stock everything else.

I don't understand why the Speedster is getting so many people excited when its basically just a roadster version of a GT3  Touring. 

Its kinda like an Aventador Roadster with a top you have to take off yourself instead of pushing a button. They could've made it a variant of the GT3 but they felt the need to make it limited production just to get people excited about it. 

I'd rather get a GT3 touring and spend the extra 100k+ on a better car on the side.

And for those who would argue that the Speedster will shoot up in value later, many people think the GT3 Touring will as well, because of it being the only N/A Manual 991 Porsche 911

I have had two Z3 roadsters in the past, the 2.8 and then the 3.0 but there is no comparison.

Hi everyone, hope this is allowed here. The other car identity subs seem to all require a picture, which if I had then I wouldn't need to ask.

I swear I've seen a classic car with 30s styling that had headlights that popped out sideways from the radiator, in between the hood and fender. When closed they have two decorative round plates on either side concealing them, and those plates hinge backwards when the lights emerge. The particular model I saw I believe was white with gold detailing, but I might be remembering the coloring wrong.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone,

This turned into a long one. I hope you enjoy.

I have been passionate about cars since I can remember. It was the first thing I remember being passionate about and has remained one of my greatest passions. In particular, sports and supercars. I spend endless hours on YouTube salivating over them.

By my mid 20s I was saving up to get into a Z4 and after a bigger than expected pay rise I was fortunate enough to get into a Z4MR. Photos [here]( It has been an incredible experience with the peak being a 4,000 mile drive around the mountains of Western Europe. Videos [here]( and [here]( Yes, I still have it.

I have been debating a step up for the last year or so. The full journey is a bit of a story but the short version is that last week I finally did it and bought this Audi R8 Spyder - 2010, V10, Manual in Sepang Blue with Black Leather and the options I cared about.

In this post I am sharing my (on reflection, apparently considerable) initial impressions. If you would like to know more about the car, my journey to getting it or anything else please let me know.

So, my initial impressions:

**DRIVING:**

**Power** \- Naturally a significant step up from the Z4M and you can feel the difference in the acceleration. Quite simply, you are moving a lot faster a lot sooner – that sounds obvious but sometimes the most obvious things are overlooked and can be the most impactful. Specifically, when you are hurtling towards a corner with more weight, with more width, lower down and at higher speed than you are used to, you notice it and your adrenaline pumps. However, the difference in the acceleration is less pronounced than I expected and I think this is because of the way the power is delivered. Specifically, to me the Z4M feels more 'raw' where the R",1559687259.0,2019-06-05 00:27:39,1623,238,Jonsus0306,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/bwv1g1/new_to_me_r8_spyder_v10_manual/,True,0.94,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,btoym7,,"Car enthusiasts, what are some of the best random ""Hello, fellow car guy!"" road connections you've made?","Call it ""the wave"", ""the nod"", ""hello, fellow car guy""... whatever. It happens to every car enthusiast eventually. You make an intimate connection with a fellow car enthusiast out on the road. 

I remember watching this old Petrolicious video about two guys that became best friends after one approached the other about his Datsun Roadster at a gas station and would like to imagine these things happen often.

I recently caught up with an old friend from college and she reminded me that she always thought it was strange yet amusing. She has no interest in cars whatsoever. In her home country she spends most of her daily commute on a train.

One morning I was driving her back to her dorm and there just so happened to be a big (big enough where people caravan to it) European car show taking place that day along the same highway. I was driving my M3 and there was a caravan of classic BMWs (bunch of E30s and E28s). They were at a slow cruise so we passed them and as we did they honked, waved, gave a thumbs up, and snapped some photos. She turns to me with this confused look and proceeds with the, ""Are they your friends? No? Why are they taking photos of us?"".

Another time we were driving along the beach and an E90 M3 passes us going the other direction. I stop at the red light, glance in my rear view, and see him bust a U-turn and gun it back towards us. He pulls up next to me which startles the hell out of my friend. But it ends up just being this super enthusiastic nice guy asking me a bunch of random questions about the car.

post,bkho9j,,Tesla Model 3 AWD vs. C7 Corvette Grand Sport,"I’ve been daily driving Corvettes for the past (7) years or so. I had 5 years in an old C5 Corvette and spent the last two years in a C7 Grand Sport. While I *love* Corvettes my life has slowly become more complicated to the point where daily driving a C7 Grand Sport has been less and less of a joy.

Now don’t get me wrong, Corvettes are the most daily-able sports cars you can get. Plenty of trunk room, an honest 30mpg if you drive them calmly, the cars are reliable, and they are generally affordable to repair/maintain. For me though, I just recently got married, moved to a place that made for a commute that was a bit more tedious than it was fun, and in general was beginning to feel a bit limited/stressed out when driving my Corvette (more on that later). So I decided to trade in my C7 Grand Sport for a Tesla Model 3 non-performance AWD. Here are my thoughts!

**Buying Experience**:

Buying a Tesla is a generally seamless and enjoyable experience, but there are some points that are a bit unnerving.

Test driving a Tesla is literally as easy as walking into your nearest store and saying“Hi I want to test drive this model”, and 5 minutes later you’re behind the wheel of whatever models they have available. The sales staff is generally pretty friendly, helpful, and polite, and there is very minimal if any sales pressure.

Compared to your typical dealership experience, where you often have to deal with a salesman sizing you up, etc. This is a much better way to test-drive a vehicle. For instance if you want to drive a 100K+ Model S P100D the answer is “Absolutely, let me grab your co-pilot and do you want any water while we wait?” as opposed to “well let’s see if you can afford it first”

The actual ordering experience is a bit odd/sketchy at times. You have to order your car online and when ordering you place a $2500 deposit to reserve your chosen configuration. It is rather difficult to figure out how much you’re actually purchasing the car for if you’re just using ",1556945601.0,2019-05-04 06:53:21,219,149,eaglerulez,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/bkho9j/tesla_model_3_awd_vs_c7_corvette_grand_sport/,True,0.85,2019,both,search,False,False,0,
post,bjtkpq,,AWD Mid-Engine DeLorean Idea,"Hey All,

I often like to try to think up ludicrous build fantasies to possibly make in the future. I finally watched ""Ready Player One"" a couple weeks ago and have watched it an additional 3 times since. I've always loved DeLoreans, but never really considered one for myself because that besides the appeal for enthousiasts.... the're just honestly not good cars. That's when I thought about building one for performance and reliability. I would want something that I could drive daily, but still unleash hell with if I decide to. Here are some of the basic ideas I had for it:

\- LS based engine, probably Ls7 or LSX (built somewhere between 600-800 hp, preferably with a high redline).

\- AWD conversion to properly put that power to the ground and general awesome performance, not just in a straight line.

\- Upgraded chassis, most likely working with Roadster Shop or some similar company for a complete custom build.

\- Brand new body, built from scratch. I found out that DMC came back into business restoring DeLoreans and selling the thousands of spare parts they have from cars that were never made. May as well go through them and just bolt together a basically new body for sub $20k rather than spend much more on a body in worse shape and molest an original car.

I'm legitimately thinking of pursuing this, as it would be a dream to make happen. I think it would almost be doable if I sold both my cars to fund the build. For reference I have a 2010 APR Stage 3 GTI and a 1976 Dodge 3700 GT (only one of it's kind in the US, plus with lots of work done to it).

Let me know if you guys think this is even possible! It's a lofty idea, but could be something seriously rad.",1556794659.0,2019-05-02 12:57:39,5,20,ca_funderthuck,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/bjtkpq/awd_midengine_delorean_idea/,True,0.58,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I think I've thought of a solution to this. In response to this (seemingly) last resort criticism of electric cars, when range and speed problems are solved, why don't most automakers like Porsche (for the Mission E) or Tesla (for the new Roadster) do what BMW has done with the i8?

post,6nrov8,,Open request to the electric vehicle industry: Make us an electric 4wheel drive.,"Hello. 

I am a motoring enthusiast. I fit into a relatively large niche of the motoring enthusiast community in that I am mainly interested in off-road driving. Although I enjoy watching car races; F1's, V8 Supercars, top fuel drag races, drift races, I even geek out a bit on the big street rods and I don't mind going to car shows and show'n'shine events, I don't own a big horsepower car and I probably never will. The main type of motoring I am about is off road driving. I LOVE the sense of freedom you get when you just turn off the side of a road and hook into the bush, or cruising over wide open sand dunes. I love seeing how far I can get. I love conquering mountains, even if it means I have to park up somewhere in the scrub and hike the rest of the way. I love getting stuck and having to pull out the winch. I love off-road touring, to me its the purest form of motoring - taking the freedom that *having* a motor vehicle gives you to the absolute extreme. Club events, hanging out with a bunch of other like minded people/families, cooking up a barbeque somewhere out in the wilderness, a secluded swimming hole that not many people ever get to see. Its really incredible. My point is, I love motoring, but I don't really care about going fast. 

Some of you might have seen the post on the front page recently about the Top Gear crew scripting/manufacturing a breakdown of the Tesla Roadster without even ever having seen or driven it ... As a motoring enthusiast I was not surprised at all by this. Appalled yes, surprised not in the least.. In the community circles of which I am a member, electric vehicles aren't cool. But not only are they not cool, the advent of electric vehicles is seen as somewhat of a threat to our lifestyle. 

Me personally, I don't see EV's as a threat to my lifestyle, because what I'm into is a bit different. I don't care so much about the grunts and rumbles you get when you open up the carby on a big V8. I mean don't get me wrong, I enjoy the big ",1500278197.0,2017-07-17 09:56:37,22,28,petehehe,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/6nrov8/open_request_to_the_electric_vehicle_industry/,True,0.95,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,64zijf,,"ICE maker responds to EVs dominating drag racing. How will EVs take back the crown and most importantly, which company?","Hello,

The new Dodge Challenger SRT Demon promises 9.65s time to the quarter mile and 2.3 s from 0 to 60 mph, which is pretty much on par or better than the best currently available EVs and the best announced EVs to be released in the following years. 



I know most won't even try to argue that it's important to win on these metrics but it's obvious from the fame that Tesla has gained, it's vital to the perception of electric cars to stay ahead of the competition in order to accelerate acceptance among the public. It's easier to convince the opinion makers that faster EV adoption is a desirable thing and not a threat to them and it's something that should be supported instead of fighting against it.

Now to the challenge at hand, who is going to make an electric, production muscle car to beat a 9.65s quarter mile time and cost $100000 or less? Technically it should be achievable given how drag racing electric cars have done better than that in the past, however bringing that sort of performance to street legal production cars and within budget, profitably is a huge challenge. Short of waiting for next generation batteries to just brute force EVs ahead of the competition, will someone try to address the challenge with current technology? I know Tesla is developing a second generation Roadster but that's still some time away from now, likely after 2020.

Regardless of that, I think that if the performance claims are proven right after release, an arms race will begin among car manufacturers, EV makers can't afford to just stand aside and watch given how they are the least hampered by regulation, non existent due to obvious reasons for emissions and energy consumption.",1492017173.0,2017-04-12 19:12:53,7,12,chilltrek97,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/64zijf/ice_maker_responds_to_evs_dominating_drag_racing/,True,0.82,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

A few summers ago, my home was without power for several days.  The power outages got me thinking:  What would I do if my vehicle was electric?

Ideally, I'd also have solar roof panels and a PowerWall, but that's all additional money I don't have yet.  One alternative I considered was driving to the nearest public charging station, which sounds inconvenient yet viable depending on proximity.

post,739fbk,,"UBS Evidence Lab tears down the Bolt, huge breakdown of EV costs in general and comparisons to the ICE supply chain","Found this posted in /r/BoltEV, this is an incredibly interesting breakdown of everything that goes into the Bolt, how it stacks up to the Golf as far as TCO,  when the inflection points are for EV sales, how Tesla stacks up as well, and much much more about the future of EV's in general.

[Here is a link to the PDF itself](

Some findings that stood out to me:

* The Bolt, by cost, is 56% manufactured by LG, including the battery pack, electronics, and infotainment
* EV's are cheaper to produce than predicted
* This analysis increases UBS's projected EV sales by more than 50% by 2025
* Bolt has only 35 moving and wearing parts, as compared to 167 in a Golf
* TCO breakeven for a Bolt vs a Golf projected to be 2025
* Annual maintenence costs for a Bolt are $355/year lower than a Golf
* In the unlikely even that a 2017 Bolt battery is dead by 2025, battery replacement (factored with reduced battery costs) would still be cheaper than the TCO of a Golf (and this assumes that the Golf's engine and transmission never breaks down!)
* TCO parity between a Bolt and a Golf happen in 2018 (!) for europe, 2023 for China, and 2025 for the US
* They consider the Bolt to be maintenance-free
* Biggest winners: Battery manufacturers, Cobalt and Lithium mines
* Biggest losers: dealerships, aftermarket parts companies, ICE metal tooling companies, precious metal suppliers (i.e. catalytic converters)
* To meet the upside of UBS's EV predictions, the world needs 27 more gigafactories
* Further cost cutting for EV's involve changing the mix of cobalt in the battery packs, currently 1:1:1 NI Li Co, expected future chemistry to be 8:1:1, nickel is cheap and plentiful
* Other cost-cutting involves motor designs that reduce or do away completely with precious metals like neodymium
* The motor of the Bolt only costs $1200, with $800 for the motor itself and the rest for the gearbox/housing/etc.  I find that incredibly cheap as compared to an ICE.
* Tesla has a leg up on most other companies d",1506706866.0,2017-09-29 19:41:06,85,19,subconciousness,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/739fbk/ubs_evidence_lab_tears_down_the_bolt_huge/,True,0.99,2017,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,avequb,,Electric Car Market Overview (comprehensive interactive chart),"We have been building an EV comparison service and decided to create a useful and simple tool that gives you a birds-eye view of the market. It is available to anyone free of charge: 

 [** 

&#x200B;

The EV Market Overview looks like this:

[EV Market Overview](

**How to use it?**

1. Choose the cars you want to compare or analyze the entire market. You have a whole set of filters at your disposal. Filter by body style, price, make, status, drive type or DC charging capability.
2. Select the specs to be shown on each axis. The following options are available: Range, Battery pack capacity, Acceleration, Engine Power, Engine Torque and Efficiency.
3. Watch how do different electric models compare on your custom chart and discover interesting interrelations and trends.
4. Hover on a car to see more info. Click on it to go to the model page, which contains detailed a description, high-quality photos, video reviews, safety ratings and Disqus widget to share your impression with other EV Compare users.

&#x200B;

**Interesting observations  at a glance**

 1. Range and battery pack capacity are closely related (what a surprise). But look how far the Tesla Roadster concept has gone! 

[New Tesla Roadster heads to Mars](

2. There is only a slight correlation between range and MSRP. So the higher price does not necessarily mean greater range. What’s more, there is a noticeable gap in the middle, which signifies a lack of mid-range EVs. 

[EV Range and Price](

&#x200B;

3. Another important thing to mention is the inverse relationship between battery pack size and efficiency. It is more visible among high-end EVs.

[Battery pack size and efficiency](

&#x200B;

4. Tesla's superiority is clear. No matter what specs you choose, Tesla models are always on the top forcing other automakers to catch up.

Knowing that there would be some engineering hurdles to tackle (inverter, switches, home wiring, software, etc), how much interest is there for using an EV as a battery backup? 

&#x200B;

Some back of the napkin math using calculations from Tesla's powerwall site shows its cars could theoretically support usage of a small home for almost 2 weeks.

Given how it's uncertain if gas stations will be able to afford staying open, I had a thought that electric converted gas stations (equipped with powerwall type storage options) could plug into local utilities and act as the neighborhood failsafes like in the case of surges, blackouts or high demand.
Additionally you could add solar to the gas station and/or top up the on-site storage overnight (lower rates if sourced from utilities) to resell at higher rates later. 
A way for the owners of these stations to make money from the failsafe service could be a monthly fee paid by utility customers.

post,ecp9w1,,"AC to DC conversion, LVDC and EV charging","I’ve recently been reading about Low Voltage Direct Current and how the current AC grids aren’t really compatible with most domestic usage, which is based on DC devices (electronic devices and LED lighting mostly), and how PV panels generate DC electricity and batteries operate with DC energy, which made me think about solutions like Tesla’s solar roof and home batteries, and came up with a few questions:

1) How does Tesla manage charging in homes with PV panels and Tesla batteries? Are they providing DC straight from the PV/battery combo or is electricity being converted to AC before being delivered to the car so that it can be converted again?

2) AFAIK, the only available domestic DC charging solutions for EV’s are based on CHadeMO, which actually feature V2G capabilities, but these are not widely available yet and virtually all domestic solutions are AC. I believe that the type 2 plug has some sort of limited DC capability even without the extra CCS pins but I have not been able to find any info for type 1 plugs.

post,dx7vbq,,My 1000 mile Tesla electric road trip,"I decided to take a Model 3 with FSD for a road trip 1000 miles to key west. This is the account of that trip.

Leaving a on Thursday with a full charge I found that a ""310 mile range"" isn't on the highway at 80MPH. 230 miles in I was charging at the super charger. The supercharger is slick and quick to plug in with no sign in or anything. That is nice. Charge speed is a joke. I hit 144KW... for a few minutes. Then it tapers very hard. A full charge would take an hour, so I left at 20 min to go to a destination charger at a BBQ place. Honestly the supercharging thing is still a joke. It allows you to take your town car for a long trip when needed, it is not a great way to travel. A rage extender is far better. I spent about 4 hours of my trip at super chargers. If I took my van I would have stopped twice with its 500+ mile range, and taken 5 min to fill up each time. I expected supercharging to take longer, but not that long with an advertised 150 KW charge speed, and a 70 KWH battery in a model 3. I figured it would be a 15 min stop to get 200 miles of range. In reality that took 45 min to get 200 miles of range.

The superchargers are in stupid places mostly. One was in an airport parking lot, another was in an industrial complex. No place to potty, no place to grab a drink. Why the hell didn't Tesla put these in Gas station parking lots? I know they have those concept locations with a cafe, but really....? Honestly supercharging was a joke.

On to the car. The tesla was a almost new Model 3 LR. FSD was turned on (more on that in a minute) it had upgraded wheels, and looked good in red. The car had plenty of power, the HVAC system was great, sound system was great, comfortable ride, plenty of cargo room. Headlights were very good, but I think the glare was bad on other drivers, I got flashed headlights all night. The high beams are super bright and completely useless anywhere there are cars ahead, lol.

post,bue3qw,,Are these reasons valid for not buying a Tesla at this time?,"My mom 's advice is generally to wait a few more years before buying a Tesla.... (or any other EV with an much driver assistance/FSD capability).  She has repeatedly told me that the engineers at her company (in a not very innovative industry segment) have said that they won't be buying a Tesla because of 2 major concerns:

&#x200B;

1) If your Tesla is in autopilot mode and causes an accident where some person (other than you the owner or insurer of the car) is killed, who is responsible?  No EV company is going to admit right away that it was their SW that caused a fatal accident....  Furthermore, the insurance company is never really on your side and will do everything in their power to NOT cover you - they will try to say that  ""a computer fault cannot be proven"" and leave you holding the bag for all the damages...

&#x200B;

This concern might be allayed by the fact that I believe Tesla is going to offer their own insurance plan....

&#x200B;

2) Those same engineers told my mom that they are concerned about software bugs similar to that of the Boeing 737 Max 8.....  They think that only time will tell if there is such a serious bug that causes injury and/or deaths because the driver isn't able to take control back from the SW.....

&#x200B;

Are those concerns that the engineers told my mom, and which she subsequently told me are her reasons to be against Tesla in particular and EVs in general, at all valid at this time???",1559133232.0,2019-05-29 14:33:52,7,26,DerPhilosoph,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/bue3qw/are_these_reasons_valid_for_not_buying_a_tesla_at/,True,0.69,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,k00dj6,,Against Conspiracy Theories,"There are two Musk conspiracy theories that seem to be especially pervasive on social media:

1. Musk was involved in a coup in Bolivia.
2. Tesla employs or otherwise supports child slave labour.

The claims are extremely spurious and simply don't match reality. u/skpl [wrote a couple of excellent]( [comments pointing out their flaws]( and I decided to post them as a top level post to combat misinformation.

# On Bolivia and Lithium

Here are the facts surrounding this

**Context:**

Someone on twitter said to him (they had been spamming his replies with this):

>You know what wasnt in the best interest of people? the U.S. government organizing a coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia so you could obtain the lithium there.

He responded:



>We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.  
>  
>Also, we get our lithium from **Australia**

It's like saying ""We'll Photoshop the world into a globe as much we want. Deal with it."" to flat earthers as a joke.

&#x200B;

Musk followed up on it:



>Some of whom seriously think Tesla toppled the Bolivian govt (sigh)

**That's all this is about!**

&#x200B;

**Tesla's Lithium Supply**

[Where does Tesla get it's lithium from?](

>Albemarle and Ganfeng turn spodumene concentrate from Australia into lithium hydroxide in China. This lithium hydroxide then gets shipped to Sumitomo in Japan, where the cathode material for Tesla’s battery cells is produced before getting shipped across the world again to Panasonic in Gigafactory 1 in Nevada.  
>  
>Two other key suppliers of this inorganic compound in North Carolina, Livent and Albemarle, reprocess carbonate coming from the US, Argentina, and Chile into lithium hydroxide and send that to Japan for use in the cathodes for Tesla’s battery cells.

post,genu1a,,Decoding Elon's Success,"So, I wasn't even a huge fan of Elon before I started researching him for a brand new podcast and article series which I'm calling *Success Decoded*.

I've wanted a Tesla badly ever since I watched the Model X unveiling live in 2015, and had a lot of respect for him, but just didn't know much about him except that he was part of Paypal.

I chose Elon to profile first as he is the most interesting, accomplished and visionary person in the world. 

Now, I would *definitely* consider myself a **huge** fan.

So the podcast is completely ad-free, just wanted to focus on pure value.

It's gonna be a 3-parter:

\- Part 1 is out, and it's 30-mins on Elon's early life up to when he sells Zip2 and becomes a multimillionaire. 

\- Part 2 will be about SpaceX, Tesla, and all the industries he's disrupting. 

\- Part 3 will be the analysis of his success and what lessons we can learn.

I've tried to make it as accurate as possible, using the Vance biography plus loads of interviews with him (especially ThirdRow one which was awesome).

I've also tried to make it a relaxing listen. It's the first podcast I've ever produced so any and all feedback welcome!

post,jdafvj,,The internet in my Model X may have given a hint to a future Elon plan,"Elon is a genius. We all know this. But something caught my attention the other day that ended in a massive AH HAH moment that I think is a hidden preview of what to come. We all know Elon loves to surprise people - and this is probably on the future docket.

UPDATE: TL/DR: looks like they just filed with SEC for Starlink in moving vehicles. BOOM CALLED IT. 



I drive a 2020 Model X. I was on the freeway in autopilot just looking at my Robinhood app (safely of course...) and I was waiting for it to load. waiting... and waiting... We all know the internet on a Tesla isn't exactly the best. It's pretty dull to be honest. And then it got me thinking... Why? Why is the internet so bad on a Tesla. Surely Elon has a reason to overlook such a fundamental detail of an otherwise very futuristic car. And then I started down the rabbit hole....

I remembered a series called ""Future Car"" with Neil Degrassi Tyson a few years back and there was this quote that he said that always stuck with me (i'm paraphrasing as best I can here..)...

""In the future - cars will be able to travel within 2 inches of each other at 200 mph... because cars will talk to each other. One car will be able to hit a pot hole in the middle of a lane, and then communicate to a network to the rest of the fleet that a pot hole exists there, and to avoid it. The rest of the fleet can then maneuver safely around it.""

It was at this point then that I looked over at my dashboard and admired the new Tesla update - the fancy schmancy new Suspension update that shows the real time bounce and shock rate of each strut. Man that's a lot of data....

As I looked back at my Robinhood app I remembered for a moment that Elon had recently launched a new round of global satellites for his new company that he is going to be going public with - Starlink. For those not aware - Starlink concept is simple...

post,gb1z42,,"Why Elon is using ""Deus Ex"" as Twitter profile pic - a theory","Maybe this has been answered, if so I didn't find it. 

So anyway my theory is just that it's a semi-clever play on what he's doing on Twitter at the moment. He is seecking out Trump supporters and answers/retweets them with regards to ending the lockdown. That way he is using Trump supporters, basically one of the few groups larger than his own following, to further his agenda - ""freeing"" the country. That way, Trumpers are his Deus Ex Machina: sudden help from an unexpected source. Or balant opportunism as you might put it more bluntly. 

And even his stock options - I think there is a good chance that he is after those not for personal gain, but because his opinion is that he will use the money better for humanity than if it goes someplace else. And in this logic even a few more lifes lost would be inferior to the bigger goal of saving humanity.

I'll go get my tinfoil hat now, but I thought it's at least an interesting theory :)",1588273471.0,2020-04-30 21:04:31,4,10,nohiddenmeaning,elonmusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/elonmusk/comments/gb1z42/why_elon_is_using_deus_ex_as_twitter_profile_pic/,True,0.56,2020,both,search,False,False,0,

The US automotive and energy company had announced plans in November to construct its first European car factory in Gruenheide near the Berlin Brandenburg International Airport located southeast of Berlin.

post,husvkj,,If Elon Musk was also able to apply his genius mind to water desalination and purification he could further dramatically change the world for the better even faster than he currently is.,"If the efficiency and rapid building of the Giga/Tera factories could be globally replicated and applied to desalination plants in a way that was cheaper and more efficient than currently designed and built as well as open sourced, not only would he have supercharged the sustainable energy and transport sectors but he could also massively boost solutions to the upcoming global water crisis(hopefully before it becomes much worse) which could in turn allow for food to also be grown at the scale needed in locations where it is currently unfeasible(where there is plenty of land but no water) for the growing global population.  Allowing for potentially less global conflict over resources that if used smarter and better could be in abundance.

I'm sure there are many other great minds that would be very willing to contribute to such a project with him to lighten the work load and make the world a better place.

post,ijk1m4,,What kind of impact on Society could Neuralink have?,"Elon Musk definitely seems to be aiming higher than just eradicating neurological issues with his work, the live demo yesterday has brought alot of interest to me about its very potential in becoming the next revolutionary tech, like the Iphone.

All the bold claims that Elon Musk believes are possible suggests that Neuralink could actually connect mind and tech, there is also the possibility that Neuralink or future versions of Neuralink could learn new things about the already complex human brain. Someone asked if consciousness could be explained with it and Elon believes its possible.

If Neuralink is able to become the standard piece of mind-tech interface within the decade, society could be transformed alot. Things such as telepathic communication, digital info streamed into our sight/hearing, control of our dreams and memories, gaming, and more that could be possible with the new data we could discover about the human brain.

While all these things could be wonderful to hear, the impact on societal could be completely drastic and unpredictable. Some ideas that I had were the following:  
\-The usage of memory recording for crime investigations or a ""lie detector""

\-Most advanced and fastest training on basically any skill. The worst skill probably being able to control weapons of war with a single thought. Imagine an army of cyber soldiers controlled by the mind of one general.

\-Heavy advancements on AI due to the ability that we can study our own brain better and more progressively.

\-All of humankind being able to access all the available internet and maybe even ""download"" wikipedia into themselves, thus meaning a whole, educated, species. But at what cost?

post,a0nrx7,,"Tesla Solar installation, pre and post discount","I'm currently working with Tesla to try to come up with an estimate for a solar system for my home. I've gotten a few different quotes from them so far. One was an initial ""rough draft"" based on sat photos and some questions I answered. This quote was also provided prior to Tesla announcing the price drop of their solar installations. The total came out to around 29.5k for the solar portion alone including materials and labor (28 panels). The projected output was 8.82 kWs.

[

The second was post-site survey and after Tesla announced the price drop. The price of the solar system went from 30 to about 23, but after they removed about 6 panels from the design (22 instead of 28) because of vents and other roof aspects discovered in the site survey. This price supposedly also reflected the new price drop. Because of the reduced number of panels, the projected output dropped to 7.15 kWs.

Finally, I was offered another design that would put panels on the other side of my roof to get the number of panels and output back up. The north side isn't as efficient as the originally proposed south side, but it would do the trick. This new proposal put the price back up to 30.5k after adding 8 panels back in for a projected output of 9.75 kWs.

Basically, I'm trying to make sure that I'm getting the new, reduced prices. I created a spreadsheet out of the three proposals to compare them. While I understand that the solar system is a blended rate based on a margin target they need to hit, the pricing of the systems appears to be roughly the same across all three. My price per panel after ranges between $1020 and $1055 across all three. If one of these quotes is pre-discount, then I'm not seeing it.

Now obviously, it's possible that the discount went into effect a few days prior to the official statement, but if that's the case I have nothing to compare against and that's my problem. So my question is, has anyone here gotten a Tesla/Solar City system installed before and if so, what",1543267820.0,2018-11-26 22:30:20,22,35,Byshop303,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/a0nrx7/tesla_solar_installation_pre_and_post_discount/,True,0.81,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,9svjgh,,There is no going back...the future is now.,"I've always been a ""car guy"".

I avoided test driving a Model S because I have this defect where I end up buying something after driving it.   Icouldn't afford an ""S"" at the time, so I never drove one and thus never truly understood what it's like driving a Tesla.

I've been obsessing for years over Teslas, and also obsessing over efficiency and climate change.  When the IPCC report came out early October I decided I had to do more.

I live in an area where after I put solar panels on my roof, my neighbors informed me that ""climate change is a hoax"".

The electrons coming out of my socket are largely coal powered.  I built a spreadsheet comparing all of the available options and their corresponding co2 emissions according to the Union of Concerned Scientists based on my zip code.

The spreadsheet told me I had 2 choices.  The Prius Prime and the model 3 are roughly equivalent in co2 emissions today based on my power mix (my roof isn't big enough to go pure solar).   But the Tesla will improve as the grid improves.  The prius...not so much.

The Tesla also improves if I move to a state with a more progressive energy policy / mix (hopefully soon).

So 2.5 weeks ago I ordered my LR AWD 3.

My delivery experience has been fantastic.  The price of my car dropped $2k between ordering it and taking delivery.

My local SC called to ask me to take delivery tonight because they have so many cars they just received they are running out of room...so I got it a week earlier than expected...which completely made my day/month/year!

The delivery experience is not at all like any other car manufacturer.

When I arrived for delivery, the SC personnel were extremely friendly.

My wife brought a deck of cards to entertain our daughter explaining that ""she knows there is a bunch of paperwork to sign and our kid will be bored.""  The delivery person said ""Uhhh...yeah, so this will be the best car purchase experience you have ever had....trust me...I know...I used to work for a 'dealer'""

post,9jsbx9,,Need Advise on Delivery Repairs,"Hi,

  
I also posted this in teslamotorsclub-> Model 3 forum but I think it might get more answers here, so excuse me if somebody reads the duplicate.

&#x200B;

To make a long story short, I found and documented several issues at delivery (around a month ago) of my Model 3 in SF Bay Area:  
1.- Scratches in the roof  
2.- Paint issues  
3.- Dent in the leather in the lower middle piece in the back seat (see pictures)  
4.- Some light stains in passenger and back seats (like if somebody with solar cream sat there) (see pictures)  


After taking it to my closest Service Center here in SF Bay Area a week ago, they just called me and told me that it just came back from the body shop and roof was replaced and paint defects fixed. They don't have the Tesla logo but they will install it for free when it arrives.  


For fix #3, they told me they couldn't bring it up to normal look, and they would like to compensate me with the first annual service, valued at $850, for free. They said, otherwise they would need to replace the whole seat and it's back ordered and it will take very long time.  


For fix #4, they promised a full detailing to try removing the stains. But when I asked him now, they said that the detailing guy was out and he couldn't do it. They offered a voucher for a full detailing later on when the car is dirtier since the body shop anyway cleaned it up.   


So I'm not sure what to do with #3 and #4. They gave me a car with a dent (look picture attached) and I feel bad if they have to replace the whole seat. I don't know what is the right compensation but I don't want them to give me something of no value (or less value they claim).  
Same for #4, if they don't do the full detailing and I just take the car and the stains don't go away, I'll feel like they delivered a car in sub-par conditions and they didn't do anything to fix it or at least compensate in good faith.  


Any advise is highly appreciated it. I haven't picked up the car yet.  


Thanks.

post,95ju74,,Powerwall 2 without Solar for TOU demand shift,"I search the forums a bit and couldn't find some good answers.

Long story short, I'm looking to buy a Powerwall 2 Solely for the purpose of demand shifting. According my calculations, the ROI is around 900 a year in electricity savings just with a single Powerwall. Has anyone else done something like this?

While preparing for a model 3, I've been running some calculations with the cost electricity. Since i'm in the bay area, PG&E EV-A rates have significant cost savings for off peak electric usage.

I use around 15-25 kWh of electricity per day without EV, around 50% of it is during peak hours, 25% during partial peak, and 25% during off-peak hours. If i can shift my all my consumption off from peak hours, which seems to be easily do-able with a single Powerwall 2, I can reduce my electricity bill by around 900 a year. This number alone makes Powerwall 2 economical WITHOUT tax incentives since the payback period for battery plus installation is around 7 years. Plus, I get a backup power system for power outages as well.

I am not planning on getting a solar system since:

1. I have plans of re-roofing my house in around 5 years (thus it doesn't make sense to install solar on the roof and then reroof)
2. my baseline consumption is pretty low (around 600 kWh/mo without EV, since there is no AC on the house)
3. If I only charge during off peak, $.12-14/kWh isn't something a home solar system can compete with.

post,aaqnz4,,There’s no TSLA analyst model that accounts for what I just did...,"Meet Joules & Juice. 

About 6 months ago I started getting interested in electric vehicles. My wife and I have always been avid fans of fast, fun to drive cars (usually with large gas guzzling engines). 

In September we rented a Model 3 for a weekend trip to Chicago. From the first launch, I knew i had to have one. I spent the next month or so nagging my wife until she finally relented and we took delivery of Joules (LR RWD) in early November. 

My wife went from swearing we’d never own an electric vehicle, to stealing my car from me several times a week and leaving me with her beloved Hemi equipped Grand Cherokee. 

As the end of the year approached, I told her if she thinks she may want to switch to a Model 3, she had to make the decision quickly as the tax credit is halving soon. 

Long story short, yesterday we picked up Juice (AWD). We went from a being a family with a long tradition of gas guzzling hot hatches, and SUV’s to owning not one, but two electric vehicles. I don’t think even the most bullish analyst can account for how transformational the TSLA ownership experience is and how it completely alters the way a consumer views transport. 

Honestly, they could have told me that the car uses a type of fuel that is just slightly worse for the environment and is only sold at a station that’s just a few miles out of my way to/from work and i still would have been on board.

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results, since vehicle sales represent the automaker’s main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its third quarter 2018 deliveries: 83,500 vehicles]( – a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp proving effective in yielding great numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 55,840 Model 3
* 14,470 Model S

Model 3 not only did well, but Model S and Model X deliveries were also both significantly higher quarter-over-quarter (those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings).

Here are Tesla’s quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

post,9osvtd,,[Discussion] Musk and Tesla pay $40M fine to reimburse harmed investors. How will that work?,"Today's confirmed settlement between the SEC and Elon Musk says that Musk and Tesla will each pay a separate $20 million penalty. The $40 million in penalties will be distributed to harmed investors under a court-approved process.

Is there any precedent for this kind of process? How is that process likely to work? And who is it likely to benefit?

Specifically, who is considered a ""harmed investor"" in this case?

* Someone who shorted shares of Tesla before he announced his intention to take the company private? (Would short sellers even be considered ""investors""?)
* Someone who bought shares of Tesla after it spiked up to $380ish expecting it to eventually go up to $420, and then lost money as the market gradually determined that Tesla wasn't going private after all?
* Individuals who bought and sold stock options before and during this event?
* Individuals who have invested in ETFs and mutual funds that have holdings in TSLA?

post,9ofw5a,,Update: From modified Subaru STi to P3D+,"A while back I posted outlining my worries transitioning from a fairly modified sports hatch (2012 Subaru STi) to a model 3 (original post:  At the time I had configured an AWD model 3 but I eventually convinced myself to upgrade to a performance model with the upgrade package. Even though some of the concerns I had don't apply to my P3D+, I thought I would still share my impressions.

As I outlined in my post a while back, my Subaru was what I would consider lightly tuned for power and heavily modified for handling. Mods included a stage 2 pro-tune producing 307 whp and 337 wtq, fully upgraded suspension including ohlins road and track coilovers, upgraded sways, linkages/braces, etc. For reference, all told I probably dumped >$20k into a car that I purchased new for just under $40k. 

I absolutely loved my Subaru. It was a blast to drive, especially on tight twisty roads. One particular reason why I enjoyed that car so much didn't necessarily have to do with the car itself, but rather geography. My first few years of ownership took place along the coast of central California. Rarely having to deal with traffic and the abundance of fun backroads in my immediate vicinity made enjoying a relatively high power car with good handling characteristics and a manual gearbox a blast to own. When I moved to the SF bay area the car became a little less practical, but my vicinity to good driving roads meant it still got driven as intended on a regular basis. After another few years I moved to an even higher density area where having a manual gearbox became more of a chore than it needed to be, and a lack of any real space to open it up became apparent. This all happened to coincide with my desire to switch to an EV, especially warranted by the cheap clean electricity available in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, I am no longer in my mid-20s. A loud, rattly subaru was starting to wear on me a little bit and wasn't really ""who I was"" any longer.

We won't be able to deliver until the end of the month.""  Was scheduled for Sept 24th, then the 28th, then October 13th.  My wife and I planned a road trip around the Model 3, hitting the road Oct 19th to drive down to Florida to go to Disney and visit friends along the way.  As soon as we had that first delivery appointment we officially blocked out the time, bought tickets, booked hotel's that advertised EV parking, took vacation time off work, etc...  We're still taking the trip obviously, but the entire drive in our Mazda will serve as a constant reminder of Tesla's literal failure to deliver on 3 separate occasions.  And now we can't accept delivery until we get back, November 3rd at the earliest.

&#x200B;

There's also no longer a vin listed on our account.  Where did it go?  Did Tesla give it to someone else?  Are they selling me a story in the hopes that I just shut up and deal with their awful process?  I don't know, but it's yet another item that evaporates my trust in the company.  The worst part is that I LOVE the car - for the past 2 years I've rearranged my life and finances, rebuilt my garage, been a Tesla advocate to everyone I know... Only a customer experience this bad can make that love start to tip towards hate.  I am seriously developing some kind of Pavlovian feeling of negativity toward Tesla.

NONE of this would be an issue if they just wouldn't schedule appointments they can't keep.  If they said early on, ""you won't get your car till November"" - I'd say no big deal, we won't schedule our trip till then.  Or even if they hadn't said anything at all - again not a big deal.

post,9m553s,,Big & Talk Driver - 1500 miles in Model 3,"So I picked up my Model 3 AWD last week and immediately embarked on a road trip for a combination of work and pleasure. For a bit of background, I am a car junkie. I love cars, and my current stable consists of a Nissan GTR, Toyota 4Runner, Mercedes Unimog Camper, Volkswagen Westfalia Syncro. I traded a BMW i3 REX in on the Tesla. Other notable cars I have owned are BMW M3, M5, X5M,  911 Turbo, Subaru WRX STI, Mercedes E65, Audi R8 V10 Spyder to name a few. So cars for me are a form of enjoyment. I typically buy them for some unique feature that I feel like I don’t have. I am also a big guy. I  am 6’4 and 315lbs and before you all call me fat. I am more muscle than obese (even my doctor thinks so!).

I have finished the first leg of my trip which took me 1500 miles from Chicago to Boston to New York and now Baltimore. I thought I would write up some of my thoughts and impressions on a few topics. 

Vs. BMW i3

I posted earlier wondering if the Model 3 was really any better than the i3. As a lot of reviews I felt were more expounding the benefits of electrification vs something unique to Tesla. Overall, I have to say the Model 3 is just different from the i3. The i3 is an amazing city car, with a spacious cabin, and upright seating that gives you a great view of the road. The Model 3 sits LOW, and the view out is not as good as the i3. The Model 3 is a superior highway cruiser and way more versatile to be an only car because of the supercharging network. The Model 3 blows the doors off the i3 in performance. The I3 has instant torque, and is fun from 0-30. The AWD Model 3 can feel like a baseball bat to your back when you floor it. As an only car, the Model 3 is a better choice, but as a city only car, I still think a $20k BMW i3 REX CPO is a compelling value… until the 35k Model 3 comes. Buying new at full price, the Model 3 is definitely a better option.

post,9l9e2c,,Model 3 LR RWD review from a car enthusiast.,"**Background :**

I've held my model 3 reservation for a while and I wanted some alone time with the car to decide if I really liked it. So I decided to rent a model 3 LR RWD for a day and wrote down some of my thoughts from the perspective of a car enthusiast. I'm going to steal some formatting from /u/cookingboy 's [model 3 review]( since I have a habit of rambling. Before I begin my review I'll provide some background about myself. Normally I wouldn't include this stuff. But, there are a lot of people out there who claim Tesla fans are inexperienced in the realm of luxury and performance cars. So I thought I would include some context to help dispel some of that.

 I've been a huge car enthusiast as long as I can remember. I spent much of my youth wrenching on cars with my father and have been hooked ever since. I' m at some car event or working on one of my cars pretty much every weekend. I read about cars, watch videos about cars, and listen to podcasts about cars for hours every day. It's fair to say I'm a bit obsessed. So far I've owned an 85' Jaguar XJS 12, E46 BMW 325Ci, 2016 Mustang Ecoboost, 1991 Mazda Miata, 2006 Corvette Z06, 1993 Mazda Miata, 1991 Mazda Miata, 2011 BMW 335i, and most recently a 95' Civic. Currently, I still have the Z06, the 335i, and the Civic.  I've modified and raced pretty much every car I've owned. They're all pretty impractical, but I can't stand driving a boring car. Along with the cars I've owned, I've driven a huge variety of cars and a few of the competitors. I've driven everything from brand new Lamborghinis to base model Ford Fiestas. 

I've been a pretty big EV fan since the Tesla Roadster. The first EV I ever drove was a 2013 LEAF. Before that, I was certainly interested in electric cars. But I didn't entirely understand the appeal. A soon as I drove the LEAF, I finally understood what it's all about.  Sure it's not the fastest or most exciting car out there. But the responsiveness gives you a really good idea of what EVs",1538634101.0,2018-10-04 08:21:41,24,40,Fugner,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9l9e2c/model_3_lr_rwd_review_from_a_car_enthusiast/,True,0.67,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,9kqjy7,,Very disappointed in how Business Insider is reporting the deliveries this morning.,"Business Insider has an article that came out shortly after Tesla's news release and it is just factually wrong in many spots.

post,9js1cg,,"PSA: Before it's released, I'd like to remind everyone to PLEASE pay attention 100% of the time when 'Autopilot On Nav' and 'Auto Lane Change w/o Confirmation' are enabled.","I just want to give everybody a fresh, nice reminder about the importance of diligently paying attention while AP is active, especially because these amazing new assistance features are going to soon be available to ALL of us.

If you elect to enable 'Auto Lane Change w/o Confirmation', it is of the utmost importance that you pay attention 100% of the time while AP is active, interpreting what the car's AP system is thinking, and paying attention to what other cars around you are doing.

&#x200B;

Remember when you first started to use AP and it was a little scary, because you didn't know exactly what it was going to do for your first 100-or-so-miles with AP active? Well, get ready to be twice as nervous, because adding the ability for the car to change lanes and take exits is going to add two more layers of complexity to the AP system.

No longer can you take your eyes off the road for 5 or 10 seconds at a time without repercussion; if you aren't paying attention and the car tries to make a lane change in a dangerous situation, then checking your blindspots, mirrors, and looking ahead could be the difference between you getting to your destination in one piece, or instead, your car unknowingly pulling out in front of another car going 15mph faster than you are, a collision ensuing, and $TSLA dropping by another 10 points.

Especially right now, Tesla does not need any negative press.

My intention with this reminder is NOT to scare ANYBODY. It's just to remind owners, that ultimately we are the ones in control, and we must acknowledge this. Be safe, enjoy this awesome update when it comes, and spread the Tesla Love.

Cheers to V9!

Originally I was instilled fear by horror stories of being months without a car, and potentially receiving a cheaper ICE loaner. I also read that the service center was incredibly backed up. However, the replacement of my rear bumper has been incredibly effortless. I hope this sheds some light on the current state of the Dallas service center.

Musk tweeted about repairs being done under an hour, and it seems this is becoming a reality:"" Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour. ""[

1. I got rear ended by a Geico insured, I receive a Geico estimate of $250 for paint repair.
2. I emailed Tesla Body Service about the repair and it being an insurance based claim.
3. Tesla provides own written estimate based off photos. Tesla proceeded scheduling the repair, **They will honor the Geico insurance estimate, even if it is cheaper, to facilitate the process**.Additionally, whilst the provided estimate is for painting, they are currently only replacing the bumpers with factory paint at the same cost as repairing. This results in the rear bumper costing a total of 250 installed! FYI: Tesla paint estimate was 750, Geico was 250.
4. They schedule me 2 weeks out to wait for the part. **I can drive my car meantime**, this was a significant benefit for preventing me from getting a cheaper loaner from Geico, and having to pay for gas.
5. At the Service Center, it was **a drive-in experience,** with representatives checking you in from your car seat. they had a **90 minute turn around time for replacing the bumper,** but in actuality it was just under 60 minutes. They even offered **free Lyft** services in lieu of waiting.

* [back seats]( changed around 20k VIN (possibly earlier), comfort and height changed
* [front seats]( stitching pattern change only? 
* [suspension springs]( ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url= changed starting with 2018
* [wind noise reduction]( ongoing refinement
* [headliner from Alcantara to cloth] ( changed very early in production
* rear trunk seal change (addresses issue with hard closing trunk lid, anyone have a link?)
* trunk ceiling now has a finish piece (plastic?) there while originally it was bare metal.

* front bumper scratched underneath during unloading
* rear window cracked post delivery
* autopilot lever trim coming off
* rear bumper color does not match (only on white and has not come up recently)
* charging door not flush
* panel gaps (mostly resolved)

post,8o381s,,"Who killed the 𝐠𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 car, and when will the 𝗧𝗦𝗟𝗔 share price reach $𝟯𝟬,𝟬𝟬𝟬 ... Wait, what⁉","Readers of this sub are probably familiar with the
[""Who Killed the Electric Car?""](
2006 film, which documented that General Motors was all too
happy to [physically destroy EVs](
that people wanted to buy back:

>  ""GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual lease value;
>   $1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in Burbank, California
>   before they were crushed.""

( Which throwing away of perfectly good money seems a somewhat controversial action from a for-profit corporation. )

But I think GM's past actions and its fear of EVs is water under the bridge, and that it's time to think about the exact opposite scenario: how exactly is the future **collapse of the market for gasoline cars** going to look like, and how will it affect GM, the global automotive industry and Tesla in particular?

Firstly, let's see early indicators of stalling/dropping sales of gasoline cars, in the U.S.:

- light vehicle sales have already started [dropping in the U.S.](
  despite a strong economy and continued demographic growth
- [demand for EVs has increased by 35% compared to last year](
  now to [50 million future EV customers]( (most of whom are ICE ex-customers)
- there are zero signs that people's income or economic anxiety is constraining new car purchases,
  [personal income is continuing to rise](
- one factor that was *masking* some of the brewing trouble in ICE-land were the three major land-falling
  [hurricanes of 2017 destroying up to 1 million cars](
- [The Model 3 is rapidly taking over market share in the U.S. market](

I.e. gasoline car sales are dropping or at least flat-lining, despite most other
economic data suggesting that people have enough money to buy them.

I believe part of the reason for the drop in gasoline car sales is the demand by
50 million Americans for their next car be an EV, and that while they don't yet know
which EV to buy (or find them too expensive), but that meanwhile they *are* delaying the purchase of gasol",1527970087.0,2018-06-02 22:08:07,19,88,__Tesla__,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8o381s/who_killed_the_𝐠𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞_car_and_when_will_the/,True,0.56,2018,both,search,False,False,0,

post,7pek5p,,Model S vs Model 3,"9 March 2018: This list is not updated anymore. Check out the latest [here](

**Model 3's Advantages:**

* The Model 3 LRD has more range than the Model S 100D. Check out the numbers [here](  

* The Model 3 is 25% more efficient than the Model S which means you will pay 25% less to charge at home. 

* The Model 3 LRD has 78.3 kWh usable battery capacity (source: [page 6 footer]( vs 72.6 kWh in the Model S 75 ([source]( and 77.5 kWh in the Model S 85 ([source]( That means the Model S/X battery capacities are over advertised but the Model 3 capacity is under advertised. 

* The Model 3 battery degradation will be 25% slower than the Model S because it requires fewer charge cycles to achieve the same mileage. If you look at the graph [here]( you can see that the S and X are already pretty good but the 3 will be better. 

* The Model 3 uses the newer battery technology. The 2170 cells in the Model 3 have 18.5% higher energy density than the 18650 cells in the latest Model S based on EPA documents. S/X will probably switch to the 2170 cells in the future. That means if you buy an S/X it is likely that it will become the old technology soon. When the S/X switch to 2170 cells, this should increase the range, reduce weight and improve handling. See the calculation and data sources [here]( Also, listen to Elon [here](

* The Model 3 has the newer motor technology. These motors are lighter and have better track performance and Autobahn performance. They reduce weight and improve handling. The permanent magnet motors don't go into limp mode as quickly as the current Model S/X AC induction motors. The Porsche Mission E has permanent magnet motors for better track performance. The Bolt and Model 3 have permanent magnet motors for high efficiency. Unlike common assumptions, these motors are not the less capable economy option. They are superior in every metric. For more info see page 15 [here]( and [this]( and [this]( research.

post,yzsyar,,Tesla Model 3 Postmortem (5 years of ownership),"The other guy's Model Y postmortem ( [ ) sounded fun so I'm copying his template.

&#x200B;

After almost five years (Jan 2018, serial number under 5000), I sold my 2018 Model 3 LR RWD last weekend.   I was a Musk/Tesla cheerleader when I got it and I have become… something else… in the meantime. I'll attempt to keep this on the topic of my actual vehicle experience for the most part.

&#x200B;

# The Good

* **Performance** \- It's zippy in a straight line until you get to extralegal speeds, and stays reasonably well composed in the corners when driving aggressively.
* **One pedal driving** \- Like the other guy, I REALLY liked this.  I will miss it and am not looking forward to having to use my brake pedal more.
* **Mobile app** \- Worked well for the most part (exceptions to be mentioned elsewhere).
* **Autopilot (Just Autosteer, TACC, and driver-initiated automatic lane changes. The rest to be discussed elsewhere)**\- This was the reason I bought the car and for the first couple of years, it steadily improved.   I still have no regrets buying the car + autopilot (basic autopilot wasn't included back then, it cost me an extra $5k).
* **Sound system** \- I'm no audiophile but pretty good to me.
* **Nav/charging integration** \- This made switching to an EV pretty simple, the car would generally figure out where I'd need to stop and charge, and it got better at it over time.
* **Overall reliability** \- Not the best I've had on a new car, but far from the worst.   Never left me stranded, never had a major feature stop working.
* **Frunk -** What a great, great place to keep things you need to have with you, but don't need to access every day.
* **TPMS -** It's difficult to express how pleased I was and am with how good the implementation of that is.   Made it a dream to manage multiple sets of wheels.
* **The general EV experience** \- I didn't really want an electric car, I just wanted Autopilot (there was no serious competition to it at the time).

post,yzct79,,Tesla Model Y Postmortem (2 years of ownership),"After two years, I decided to ditch my MY 7 seater. Tesla has agreed to buy it back, and I’ve just finished signing the paper work. It’s been two years, and my heating/ac has never worked for longer than a spell of 2-4 weeks. I’ve had around eight service appointments, at different Tesla service stations to try to resolve it. On at least two of those visits, the climate control service warning came on within 24hrs of picking up the car. It’s bittersweet, as there are things about this car that I truly love, but, ultimately I’ve lost hope that they would ever be able to fix this issue. After two years, I thought it would be nice to put together a postmortem on my Tesla experience.

## The Good
* **Driving Dynamics** - My previous car was an ’08 Nissan Altima, so this was my first time having a sporty car. I really loved how fast it was. The steering wheel is great. It’s a little smaller than the average steering wheel, and combined with the tightness of the wheel, you really feel in control of the car. I hate driving cars that feel like they have a mushy steering wheel, one that you have to over turn to get the car to react. That is definitely not the case here. I’ve heard some complaints that it’s too tight, but I did not find that to be the case.
* **One Pedal Driving** - After using this, I cannot go back. I considered getting a hybrid after giving up on my Tesla, but I just don’t think I can go back to coasting, breaking, and having to putz around with the gas pedal. One pedal driving is an amazing experience, and Tesla nails it. 
* **Cargo Space** - This car had enough space, and seating that we didn’t need to cart our minivan on long road trips and vacations. The last road trip we did involved five people, a 40lb dog, the dog’s crate, and four pieces of luggage. Everything fit, and really with room to spare.  
* **20” induction tires** - These are beautiful. Probably the nicest looking thing on this car. 
* **Center console** - I was one of the earlier cars to ",1668867255.0,2022-11-19 15:14:15,840,517,LvstForLife,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/yzct79/tesla_model_y_postmortem_2_years_of_ownership/,True,0.89,2022,both,search,False,False,0,

post,xhw6zq,,"Compare xDrive40 and iX3, from a Tesla Driver","Hi,

I own an older Tesla MX 75, and am looking for a newer car with more range and the same form factor. One choice is a newer MX, which on many levels would be awesome:
-	mostly great UI and software
-	very comfortable and spacious
-	over the air updates
-	FWD

but (and these are personal preferences so don't shoot me):
-	the lack of controls and physical buttons in newer models
-	the tiny touch sensitive buttons on the UI which are a pain to hit when driving
-	the yoke
-	not available for a long time, and the price here is uncertain

These are big turnoffs. So I thought I'd try some competing products, and this weekend I test drove the BMW iX xDrive 40 and iX3. Here are my impressions of them both from the POV of an MX driver.

xDrive 40:
-	big, similar in spaciousness to the MX. It felt premium.
-	Had lots of carbon fibre in its construction
-	very comfortable seats
-	rear seats had a *lot* of room
-	didn't have a flat floor, and there was a large (and likely empty) console between the front seats. There was also a lump in the floor in the back where an old drive shaft would have gone I guess.
-	very quiet on the road. I could hardly hear other traffic.
-	the simulated engine noise was turned on, and it was both loud and obnoxious. It took us a long time to figure out how to turn it off - voice commands simply didn't work for me, and it wasn't obvious in the menus (V8 of their UI software). Only when my wife asked for it to be turned off, and when we got the right name for it, did it stop.
-	the UI (V8) was pretty confusing. There was no ""most common things to change"" page (like tesla has). Plus there was a massive page of icons to wade through which is all their ""apps"". Most car config options are hidden inside these ""apps"". There appears to be a shop with more apps you can buy?
-	The UI was touch enabled, and there was a central ""rotating/touch"" control. It was very responsive. The icons and things to touch were big.
-	It did have physical buttons for some com",1663545660.0,2022-09-19 02:01:00,2,36,LuckyLaughingKiwi,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/xhw6zq/compare_xdrive40_and_ix3_from_a_tesla_driver/,True,0.55,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Problem is, I've read plenty of anecdotes that EV owners of everything from the Model X down to the Chevy Bolt find that driving their ""fun"" weekend ICE has become dull, as the ICE driving experience just isn't as carefree as zipping around in an instantly torque-y EV.

post,x40tcu,,Used EV Prices Increase Five Times More Than Gas Car Prices,"Pretty amazing:  iseecars data shows used EV prices increased 54% in one year (thru July 2022), five times higher than ICE (10%).

Another indication of strong demand for EVs.

Interesting that the highest percentage increases were for the Leaf and Bolt -- people really want inexpensive EVs, which isn't a big surprise. Also, the Leaf had some of the worst depreciation in the industry in the past and the Bolt had a \*cough\* tough year last year.

The next five highest were Tesla Model S, X and 3, Kia Niro, and Tesla Model Y. ""Demand for used versions of the Model 3,  Model X, and Model Y was high last year before the rise of gas prices  because they were relatively scarce in the used car marketplace, which helps explain why they have not had as steep of a yearly price  increase.”

post,wx1slv,,Does anyone else roll their eyes when they encounter someone who just keeps low-key talking shit about EVs?,"To give some context, I essentially transitioned my entire immediate family into EVs.  We have a Tesla X, a Bolt, a Mach-e, and an Ioniq 5.  And we love them all.

About 3 days ago a neighbor, while I was walking around my parents' neighborhood cold stopped me and asked me if I ""lived at the house with all those EVs.""  Then asked, ""how do you like them?""

I just say I love it and that they're the best cars I've ever had the privilege of driving.

He starts low-key criticizing EVs...like acknowledging that ""they're the future but..."" then starts lecturing me about how current shortcomings like charging speed and infrastructure and how EVs are maturing too early yadda yadda yadda.

Like bruh, I know all the shortcomings that affect EVs and their owners.  I know they're not exactly a complete solution to combat climate change.  I get that you don't want to see your beloved gas vehicles go away.  But I just sat there for what seemed like several minutes of him ""lightly praising"" the my family's vehicles then criticizing it.  I couldn't get much word in.... I just nodded and ""mmhmm'd"" to the point where I just had to say that I needed to get to work.

Like I get that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but if someone's family literally owns 4 EVs, you're probably trying to convince the wrong person.

The reason why I thought of this conversation again is because of CA's announcement of an eventual ban on ICE sales.  When I read that, I thought about this dude... probably punching a bunch of walls right now.

And I remember a coworker of mine talked to me in the breakroom after seeing my Model Y back before I sold it.  He hooks me into a conversation saying ""ooh, nice car, how do you like it"" but then immediately after my answer, he said, ""I used to work for Tesla.  I hate Teslas.""  I knew then that the conversation would not go anywhere.

The [Model X and Y]( could have a more comfortable third row had they extended the cabin further into the hood space, all while maintaining the same footprint. Plus, a shorter hood allows for better visibility of the road, both for the driver as well as the autonomous driving system (especially on poor roads, snowy conditions, and for seeing kids/animals in front of the car).

post,wch9ag,,Initial impressions of the Genesis GV60,"Today I went up to Santa Monica since the dealer there had a demo which they left me test-drive by myself, but I tried to make it fairly short since there were other people wanting to test-drive it. But I had time to take it on the highway for a couple of miles and drive it around city streets a bunch, and played with the infotainment system after I got back.

The demo was the performance model with the white interior and exterior. Important note: a lot of people seem to be confused by this car's price. This car has zero options; it comes fully loaded so the price is not simply a base price. You literally choose whether or not you want the performance model, the exterior paint color, and whether you want a white or black interior. That's it. There are no other choices. It's refreshing to get a nice no-bullshit price.

** Pros **

* Excellent outward visibility. This is a big pet peeve of mine since so many cars have narrow windshields, including the EV6 (due to low roofline and high slant) as well as the EQS, Polestar 2, Volt, etc. But forward and side visibility was very good in this car; I feel it's about the same as in my Bolt, but with a less raked windshield so the A pillars are much less annoying on the GV60.

* Solid steering. My highway ride was brief but I did get up to 80 mph and detected no wiggle or looseness in the steering, when going straight or when turning.

* Pretty quiet. I did hear an annoying whir sound when accelerating but I strongly suspect (and hope) it's a fake sound that can be disabled, but I didn't have time to mess with it.

* HUD is cool, effective, and configurable. The demo had everything enabled, which in practice simply meant it showed my current speed and the road's speed limit, but you can disable that and have it only show other things such as nav directions, for example. You can also adjust the placement, if you want it higher or lower.

* Great climate controls.

post,w8ryrk,,My Tesla Model X LR... what to do?,"So I have a bit of a dilemma -- I have a Tesla Model X, 2022 Long Range that I picked up with the locked in price of $100k. I could probably sell it for $120-125k since I just picked it up and people are waiting for it.

I honestly hate the car. It's a good EV from that perspective, but for the price we paid the interior is subpar, the comfort isn't great (we did a long road trip the week we got it to vouch for that), it's loud inside at speed, and the gimmicks of the HVAC controls (no vent control other than through the screen? WTF?) and the yoke steering (horn button is a tiny capacitive button, blinkers the same, etc).

I figure with the $7500 credit available on a great many cars still available, plus the money I'd make selling the Model X... what are my options? I need comfortable seating for 5 -- 7 would be great (as our Model X is configured), and a good amount of 'luxury' features that make the car comfortable and nice to drive for long distances as well as the day to day grocery getting.

Appreciate your thoughts and suggestions. I am really not a fan of the Tesla and given the pricing I can get rid of it, just want to make sure I'm weighing my options and taking advantage of the $7500 credit that's available.

Edit: as a few people have pointed out ""why didn't you test drive it?"" -- it wasn't an option to do. I drove a 2018 (i think?) Model X to get a sense of the room inside since that was largely unchanged, but not like I took it out for a long drive to really get a sense of things as my assumption was that there would be improvements. For the yoke and other things -- you have to try to use them daily to understand the irritation I have. And the horn is just plain unsafe. None of these things can be experienced without driving the car for some amount of time. I took delivery of the car knowing it was going to be a gamble, but knowing that it would sell for more than I paid. It was a calculated risk.

post,ucf4vq,,USA: BEV share crossed 5% for the first time in Q1 2022. Tesla's market share grew to 75%.,"BEV's market share in the USA crossed 5% market share for the first time in the USA. EV sales almost doubled in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021.

Tesla continued to dominate the segment. About 75% of EVs sold between January and March were Tesla products. Its [Model Y]( SUV and [Model 3]( sedan made up 68% of the market by themselves.

The gap between the second-place Model 3 and third-place [Ford Mustang Mach-E]( illustrates Tesla’s remarkable head start in the EV race. Americans bought 46,707 Model 3s and 6,734 Mustang Mach-Es during the first quarter.

The increased competition seems like a threat to Tesla’s dominance. Incredibly, even with more competition than ever, Tesla’s lead on the field is growing. Tesla products made up 70% of the EVs sold in the first quarter of 2021 and 75% in the same period of 2022.

post,ua6szf,,[X-Post from r/Rivian] My 48hr in depth impressions of the R1T Launch Edition. AMA!,"Thought this sub might be interested! See below:

Wow, it's been a very long time coming, but I finally took delivery of my R1T LE this past Tuesday. I've been waiting since my preorder date of Dec 4, 2018 (#3174) and ran into a few snags taking delivery. First, my promised November delivery was pushed out in late November after I sold my truck, and then my R1T was available while I was on my honeymoon and selling my house. But now I'm back, sold my house (yay!), am in contract on a new one (yay!!), and took delivery the morning after coming back from Coachella (ouch!). It's been a rollercoaster ride, but my Guide has been absolutely stellar and the thing finally happened!

For this review, I'm not going to give numbers for each category. Instead, I'm going to share a ""headline"" which is what I would tell a friend in ten words or less. Then I'll dig down a bit deeper in the description. I did not include a bunch of pics because of 1) time and 2) other people have done it better! For reference, I have R1T Launch Edition in Launch Green with the All Terrain Tires and Black Mountain Interior. I also ordered the wall charger, roof racks, spare tire, and first aid kit. It was just shy of $86k after all taxes and fees.

**Ride: Impressively peppy, super comfortable, and customizable**

The highest compliment I can give is that it doesn't feel like a truck. It feels like a sportscar. It is absolutely wild to me that something this big, this heavy, feels *this solid*, is *this fast,* and is *this comfortable* to be in. It honestly has no right to be this good. For me, it's a combination between the motors, suspension, and interior quality (more on that below) that make the ride feel even more expensive than the truck is today — and how expensive it will be in the future. 

Acceleration is wild. The car is so responsive, even on my all terrain tires. It makes people scream when I punch it.

post,u9tr7a,,Thoughts on these Model X rear damages? Worth to buy?,"Hi all,

I've been a Tesla fan for a number of years. I'm in the Toronto area and over here it's almost impossible to find any used Model X's. Recently, I found a dealership that had 2018 (Feb 18', so no MCU2), no autopilot, but premium package and with relatively low mileage for an amazing price.

I visited and did a test drive. Just 2 days before, the dealership had sent the vehicle to the Tesla dealership to put brand new brake pads and rotors.

I placed a down payment and I'm doing a trade in that is supposed to take place this weekend. The salesperson sent me a text today saying that after they detailed and thoroughly washed the car, they noticed a ""thumb size"" dent on the rear trunk area that can't be popped out due to the angle. Further, the rear red hazard strip is cracked, and the plastic bumper piece is sticking out.

They said that they would contact Tesla and depending on the price, they would pay for the repairs. Does anyone have any idea how much these repairs would cost? I've attached photos in the link below and circled the damages in white.

I really don't want to make an irrational decision and while I appreciate the honesty from the salesperson, this is alarming so I'd like to get some opinions on this. Thanks in advance!

post,u05lav,,Question for people who have switched to/from Model x to another EV SUV,"I've had my heart set on a. Model X for a while. I want the Tesla suite of features (sentry mode, integrated dash cams, whatever level of FSD is available, etc), 6 or 7 seat configurations, and I just really like how the car looks overall. Also the fact that it qualifies for the section 178 and 169 for tax purposes is a huge plus. I think only the Ford truck and hummer meet the weight requirements in the EV category. The rivian vehicles also qualify but I don't want to wait until 2023/2024. 

However, during my research, I came across some other pretty intriguing options in the EV SUV arena. The fact that they still qualify for federal and state (California) rebates/credits is also appealing. I also really don't like the new yoke on the 2022 model x and how much some of the options/upgrades are. 

For those of you who switched from the model x to another EV SUV, what are some things you miss about the MX and what are some things you feel the MX could benefit from? And on the other side, people who switched to the MX, do you have any regrets? And what are some things you never knew you wanted until you owned the MX?

post,zs1h8r,,Making DIY BMW 4 convertible EV with BMW i4 internals,"Since no automaker, including BMW, is making an EV convertible with 400km or so range, I'm thinking of going the DIY EV conversion route.

&#x200B;

First, I thought to convert some ""classic"", since that's what all EV conversion companies seem to be doing/offering but I'm not really into classic cars, and I really liked my hardtop 440i back in the day, that was mostly used for summer roadtrips.

I8 roadster has literally no space for luggage, and when it comes to convertible plug-in hybrids - Wrangler is a way better roadtripper.

&#x200B;

But I really, really want an EV convertible.

Lunaz quoted around €300K for their Convertible Rover. And that's just an overkill, price wise, for me.

&#x200B;

So I thought, since i4 is not built on a dedicated EV platform but it shares a regular combustion engine-based platform with 2020s 4-series, why not get a used 2020+ diesel/petrol 4-series convertible, plus a used i4 40, and just swap internals - it's the same platform anyway.

I know convertible is shorter, so all battery packs may not fit but everything else can fit without much of manual adjustments, right?

At current market rate, the price for both used low-milage cars is just above €100K. And, I don't think that the labour/extra parts would cost €200K, that's comparing to Lunaz offer.

&#x200B;

So I wonder if anyone here with technical/engineering knowledge of 2020s i4/4-series BMW internals can confirm it's doable, because the internet is literally empty on this particular subject. All I can find is some BMW factory pictures of how internals look like.

&#x200B;

The main thing is the electronics, will they work, like swapping steering wheel, dashboard display panel and all the buttons, air con, seat heating, sensors, safety etc..

&#x200B;

Also, will i40 rear motor fit in 4-series convertible rear? Or will it have to go to the front? Like the 2nd motor does in i4 M50?

&#x200B;

I guess I just want to know if overall this is a stupid idea due to complexity of mo",1671658109.0,2022-12-21 22:28:29,17,41,roxtten,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/zs1h8r/making_diy_bmw_4_convertible_ev_with_bmw_i4/,True,0.77,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,s6282z,,Ev racecar build,"\*I cannot find 10-15kwh 360v battery pack.

Hi, to keep your attention im gonna first share the problem i've encountered in the planning process, and maybe with help from this subreddit i can find the solution.

\*I cannot find 10-15kwh 360v battery pack.

short story: so I've ben building racecars for couple years now, and the ev stuff just attracts me, so with my father in law we bought this smart roadster from Polan, it weights 790kg and is a really good starting point to build a competitive autocross car. To be competitive the car should stay under 800-900kg that's why i want to use such a small battery, the plan is to charge it between runs. The motor would come from Nissan leaf along with the invertor, just because there are plug and play control board kits like ''resolve controller"". 

For now I've just bought the car, maybe you know a better motor or battery option, or maybe you have experience that might help, i guess i just want to start a discussion about light weight ev swap racecar.",1642420054.0,2022-01-17 12:47:34,2,4,tomsonslv,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/s6282z/ev_racecar_build/,True,0.6,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,rzhu87,,How quickly things have changed [US],"I hope this is taken as a positive post. The EV landscape has changed so quickly in so many ways, that it can be hard to remember how recently none of what we have today existed. The pace of progress is astounding!

**10 years ago today:**

* CHAdeMO was the only DC fast charging standard
* There were only a couple hundred CHAdeMO stations worldwide, mostly in Japan
* Tesla was not selling any electric vehicles: it had run out of Lotus gliders to make Roadsters, but was yet to produce the first production Model S
* Of all the EVs for sale in the US today, only the Nissan LEAF was already available
* The EV heat pump had yet to be invented
* The first Tesla Supercharger had yet to be installed
* CCS was still only a proposal, yet to be deployed

**5 years ago today:**

* The Nissan LEAF was the most common EV on the road
* Tesla was selling only the Model S and Model X, and was planning a Tesla Minibus using the Model X chassis
* GM introduced the first sub-$30K 200+ mile range car: the Chevy Bolt had just gone into production
* Most other EVs available were compliance cars built on ICE platforms with limited range or regional availability: BMW i3, Fiat 500e, Ford Focus Electric, Honda Clarity Electric, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Soul EV, Mercedes B-Class ED, VW e-Golf
* Tesla had installed 1,045 Supercharger stations
* There were nearly 3,000 CHAdeMO stations, and the first 120 dual-standard CHAdeMO and CCS stations were installed in 19 states
* No EV on the market charged faster than 145 kW
* Of all the EVs for sale today in 2022, only the LEAF, Model S and Model X were already available
* Electrify America had yet to be founded, and was over a year away from installing its first station",1641697673.0,2022-01-09 04:07:53,168,144,odd84,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/rzhu87/how_quickly_things_have_changed_us/,True,0.97,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,zyhqsm,,(Almost) no speed vs range difference in semi cold weather ?,"For Christmas we drove 1500 km in one go in our E-208 from France to Denmark. It was 0-8°C outside and the range was off course lower than when we do it in the summer.

What I find interesting is that in mild temperatures you might as well go 150 km/h (top speed) all the way instead of 110 km/h. It seems like there is some kind of sweet spot between warming the batteries enough to get more efficiency out of them + less time of cabin heating and simply using less energy. Going 110 km/h still gives more range, but it is almost negligibly.

On the way home the temperature was more like 10°C where 120 km/h seemed like the sweet spot.

I thought that the E-208 had battery heating, but am I wrong?

post,ziw6ha,,December Rules Drop 🎁,"## Happy Holidays, everyone! 🎄

We hope you've been enjoying the most recent round of changes to the community, namely those surrounding mandatory tagging and strict media types for posts. I think it's clear that we're getting a lot more thoughtful question threads, a resurgence in discussion threads, and it feels like we've seen the desired drop in click-bait news items as well, which is great!

Now that things have settled a bit, we're ready to roll out the next stage of changes. Some of these changes are direct responses to observed deficiencies in the last changes, some are things you've been asking for for a while, and some are completely new initiatives designed to guide the community towards even better content and interactions.

Together, they make up some of the most consequential rule changes to this community in a long time, so sit tight, grab a cup of tea, and let's walk through them together:

## 1. Spotted posts now have explicit guidelines, and go to the queue for approval.

One side effect of the recent changes restricting media types was that since images were banned from news, the spotted tag became a dumping ground for anything that could be feasibly shoehorned into consideration as something 'spotted' — pictures of charger drama, friends' cars, and occasionally general-interest images from the internet were all being passed in contradiction to the spirit of what 'spotted' posts are really for.

Thus, we're now explicitly setting guidelines for spotted posts. They should be original content, and should capture only unreleased (or recent-release) vehicles, or rare, out of production examples. These images will also now go straight into the queue and approved at the mods' discretion to restrict the flow of these kinds of posts.

## 2. Surveys now go straight to the queue for approval as well.

One of the outstanding ambiguities with surveys has been signaling to the community which ones ones have been approved, and which ones should be reported by t",1670772127.0,2022-12-11 16:22:07,54,43,Recoil42,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ziw6ha/december_rules_drop/,True,0.9,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

At some point and probably after the big initial push to make EVs both available and affordable, I hope the conversation about miles per kw takes off. The only time I see those conversations is in places like this subreddit devoted to the subject. It's still a young market, I know, but I feel like it's important to be thinking about.

post,z2unx9,,Trip Report: Towing a teardrop trailer and camping with a Bolt EUV,"Two weeks ago now (you lose track of time when you're going through some personal issues...), my wife and I took a quick little overnight trip to the Trona Pinnacles near Death Valley.  This was mostly intended as a performance and range test for a longer trip we're planning on taking to the Grand Canyon next spring, but also of course to get away from the daily grind that we've spent way too much time in lately and see [something cool](

[Here we are all packed loaded up and ready to go](

But first, we had to make [one quick stop](

All together we're dragging 6,500 lbs down the road Beverly Hillbillies of Wrath style.  Plus the weigh of my fat ass, which I won't disclose here, since I was out of the car taking the pictures.  Granny and her rocking chair would absolutely kill the aerodynamics, though, so we had to toss her in the trailer.

The [trailer]( itself is 1,300 lbs empty, plus 34 gallons of water (situated directly over the axle) and whatever gear we weren't able to fit inside the Bolt.  At 1,760 lbs on the axle and figuring the usual 10% tongue weight, it was probably around 1,955 lbs.  The Bolt isn't technically rated to tow anything and the hitch itself claims 2,000 lbs, so this is fine, right?

My wife did most of the driving since her Bolt is the one that's set up for towing, but all in all the driving experience was fine.  You could definitely tell the trailer was back there, but the rear [air bags]( inflated to 30 psi did a lot to improve handling because they allowed the suspension to actually have some travel instead of being compressed by the weight of the trailer.  Between the airbags and the ""drop"" hitch flipped upside down, we were able to get everything perfectly level, which probably helped with aerodynamics as well.

Power was honestly a non-issue.  At ""only"" 200 hp, the Bolt didn't feel any slower than the V6 stick shift Nissan XTerra we previously towed with.  Instant torque and no shifting do a lot to compensate for a lower overall powe",1669223567.0,2022-11-23 18:12:47,131,25,WombatWithFedora,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/z2unx9/trip_report_towing_a_teardrop_trailer_and_camping/,True,0.96,2022,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1hhh4q9,,A bold Idea for Ubisoft and beyond,"Hey Elon,

I like what you’re doing and where your vision and views are leading. If you find the awkward wording here interesting, good—I have your attention. Let me clarify what I mean: “Protrude” means to stick out or extend beyond a surface. So when I say, “I like where your vision is protruded,” I mean I appreciate how your ideas stand out noticeably from the norm, even if the phrasing sounds a bit off. That said, I’m not claiming to be the brightest, but when I’m passionate about something, I try my best.

The reason I’m writing this is that I recently came across a YouTube video by Nuxanor (link: here ( He’s got a dark, intriguing perspective on things, and in this video, he dives into what’s happening with Ubisoft. As I watched him break it all down, a thought hit me: This might just be the perfect opportunity for something bold and brilliant.

So here I am, breaking down why I think this could be something worth your attention—and maybe even your unique touch. I’m not saying it’s foolproof, but I believe this idea aligns with your vision of innovation and forward-thinking growth.

Let’s dive into it:
	1.	The Opportunity with Ubisoft:
The company is at a crossroads, and with your expertise, it could be reimagined into something that transcends the gaming industry. Picture this:
	•	Integrating AI to optimize game development and deliver groundbreaking player experiences.
	•	Creating modular tools for other companies to license, lowering production costs and fostering industry-wide innovation.
	•	Building a Mars-themed game series that connects gaming with humanity’s aspirations for interplanetary exploration.
	2.	Why It Fits Your Vision:
Your work has always been about pushing boundaries, whether it’s Tesla, SpaceX, or Neuralink. A bold move into the gaming industry—especially with a focus on something as forward-looking as Mars exploration—could tie into your broader goals of inspiring innovation and progress.
	3.	The Big Picture:

Some share their personal stories of denials in payment for medical procedures and pain of loosing loved ones. Same is seen on different  TV news and in large newspapers. People are fed up. 
Only on X there is silence. On X News? Zero mention. On X Trending? Nothing! After searching very few posts can be found with the top one praising the CEO. Very few comments on it. Mostly agreeable. Don’t take my word for it. Check for yourself.
Elon Mask is anything but standing for freedom of speech. Elon is interested only in Elon’s interests. Brace yourself, America for what Elon and Peter Thiel are planning to do. Resist!

When I posted the above message the punishment came swift and severe. In just two days my account in X is suspended and I lost the ability to post any more message.

And when California governor Newsom said he is going to enact laws to prohibit such behavior Mr. Musk brought it to the court. I got curious what would happen after reading the news if I just go on X and put words in his mouth. The experiment proved that Mr. Musk is a man of double standard, a hypocrite.

On a 60 minutes segment in Australia, I remember the host asking if he knew some Australians are choosing between food on the table or heating because electricity prices are so out of hand. His response was if you need to, burn coal until you create a green energy source. I feel this showed him as a good guy with strong morals. He knew it might be an unpopular opinion, but said it at the defence of those poorer folk. I then think about how he has fired employees in the past, and how it has been done.

post,eh10la,,Thoughts on updated Model S,"I keep reading a lot about the comment about the Model S being only made for sentimental reasons and it got me wondering, why? The Model 3 is not some all encompassing design, in so that they can't target an upper market, like the Mercedes S Class. The Model S, if redesigned right, has the possibility of being a complete game-changer if they can provide the following:

- Roadster 2 inspired front fascia (there are mock-ups, but hard to find). It would revamp the image, create buzz and demand.

- Premium seats and interior, similar to an S class in quality and pop - but refined like a Tesla. This would include higher customization options for customers, and a large 4k OLED touchscreen console (making this a showcase of the car).

- Insane range and performance, truly differentiating itself from the 3, I'm talking 450+ miles with 140+ kwh battery options, and nuburgring performance kit. Tri - motor option, dual standard.

I think if we can see that in the next 2 years, they could easily charge $115k + and go back to selling a ton of them, for an extremely high margin. It just makes sense to have it as kind of a halo car in a sense, but really just as a luxury version of what they're already offering. I think Tesla showcasing their tech in a car like this would help the imagery too, and scare the shit out of the ICE cars who will be maybe on par with the 2012 model s at that point.",1577591088.0,2019-12-29 04:44:48,5,13,milehigh89,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/eh10la/thoughts_on_updated_model_s/,True,0.58,2019,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ebo8ej,,'Twas the night before Christmas,"and all through the house, all the electrons were stirring at about 10,000 gauss.               

The chargers were hung on the garage wall with care, in hopes that Musk soon would be there.

The fathers were nestled all snug in their jeans, while visions of youtube danced on their screens.

And Mama in the passenger seat, and I in the back, had just settled our brains for a lap on the track.

When out on the road there arose such a clatter, I sprang up in my seat to see what was the matter.

Outside of the window I saw a large flash,
I lift myself up to look over the dash.

Our headlights shining on the pavement ahead, automatically gave way to an oncoming moped when, what to my wondering eyes should reveal, but a Cybertruck made completely of steel. 

With an entrepreneurial driver, just rollin' in dough, I knew in a moment it must be Tesla's CEO.

More rapid than Tycans, his Teslas they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:
Model S
Model 3
Model X
Model Y
The Roadster 
The Cybertruck 
And even a Semi
To the racetrack we go, A 16 mile haul
Now launch away! Launch away! Launch away all!""

As electrons are freed from a redox reaction, they meet a complete circuit, and spring into action, so off of the line the Cybertruck flew, with a Cyberquad, and Elon too.

Our S lunged forward into the first turn, overtaking the truck my father grew stern, as I drew in my head and was turning around the Cybertruck flew past us without making a sound.

It's full of sharp angles from the front to the back, and the drivers side windows were adorned with a crack.

post,e4kv8v,,After Cybertruck Tesla will origami self-driving pods,"Elon said [Tesla will not have any major vehicle announcements for a while]( 

Why?

Because he's fairly certain by 2022 they'll have really-properly-actually-full self-driving. So starting 2022, it doesn't make sense launching any new cars designed for private ownership. Especially nothing aimed below the 3/Y, because for most budget-restricted people, [self-driving taxi pods offer much better value compared to private ownership](

And if you're making pods for fleets (either owned by, or purchased from, Tesla), you don't care too much about looks. You want the pods that are durable. You want to make them really cheaply (since you want to make a million of them for your fleet). You want their engines and batteries to last at least a million miles.

And he's checking the boxes one-by-one:

* Durable - [30x]( (stands for three-zero-something, not thirty times) [cold-rolled]( stainless steel. [Vinyl skins]( 

* Cheap to make - [XY origami design]( [new cabling system]( no paint job, continuing to improve battery tech ([Maxwell]( [Hibar]( etc).

* Last a million miles - [Recent research by Dahn and Tesla patents](

So S3XY CARS (CARS = Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster, Semi) are the complete set of Tesla vehicles to be built assuming human drivers and private ownership.

From 2022 the only new Tesla models we'll see are stainless steel origami pods of various sizes designed for computer-only driving.",1575223064.0,2019-12-01 18:57:44,7,37,shaim2,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e4kv8v/after_cybertruck_tesla_will_origami_selfdriving/,True,0.55,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,e244rm,,Theory: Cybertruck is the most easily customizable platform ever seen in automotive history,"The truck is literally just a bed of batteries with a few motors and some electronics plugged in, encased in sheets of folded metal.
   
They don't need new production lines to modify it, no new stamping machines, paint is off the menu.
   
Same production line could make a bunch of different models, just tell the machines to make the bends at different angles, cut the bed shorter, longer, skip the bed entirely, put an extra doorframe, skip a doorframe. You just weld it up and it's ready to go.
   
The 6 person truck could easily become a 3 person truck with a very long bed, or a 12 person APC.

Like a lot of people, I hated the Cybertruck at first but now my wife and I can’t wait to trade in our Model S for it. It gets more range, utility and seating than the current model S for cheaper. 

While waiting for its production, here’s some features I really want it to have:

1. Bioweapon Defense mode - It’s a no brainer on a Cybertruck. 

2. Easy entry lowering mode - With how high the ground clearance is, my wife will have trouble entering the truck if it doesn’t lower itself like an electric stallion. 

3. Shepard‘s tone sound - If the law requires artificial sound anyways, might as well make it shepherd’s scale sound so it will sound like the Batmobile. I plan on naming mine Batmobile 2077.

4. Auto tail gate/ramp - It would be amazing if I can use my phone or fob to lowers the tail gate and extend the ramp to climb up to the bed or drive the ATV on there without getting off.

5. Water resistant powertrain/interior - This would really compete against the Jeep

6. SpaceX package? - I don’t know what it will do on the Roadster but if the Roadster gets it, why not have it on the Cybertruck?

post,e0qik9,,Speculation: Cybercoupe and Cyberwagon; building an economy Tesla brand.,"The simple, non compound form of the cybertruck is an essential minimalist space frame bridging two axles.  By utilizing stainless steel and eschewing compound curves, the basic function of a vehicle can be very durably performed by this simple aerodynamic faceted shape regardless of scale.

Let us hypothesize for a moment a cybertruck frame scaled to the same outer dimensions and wheelbase of the Y called the cyberwagon, and another scaled to the dimensions of the roadster called the cybercoupe.  All the cyber branded vehicles feature durable simple utilitarian construction, with a target sub 30k for the single axle drive wagon and sub 20k the equivalent coupe to capture two whole new tiers of market.

If the cybertruck form ends up being popular, scales of it could provide a solid baseline for a simple to fabricate economy brand based on scalings of the truck to the smaller classes of vehicles.  Battery, powertrain and other component allocation issues aside, these simple to fabricate, durable rolling space frames could provide a considerable edge in competitively pricing these low end vehicles, fulfilling Tesla's mass market ideals while differentiating the upmarket Tesla (S3XY) models.

post,e0muf4,,"I love CyberTruck because it's basically a big middle finger to ""pretty"" consumer trucks masquerading as utility vehicles","Having had time to process my experience with CyberTruck, I've decided it's my favorite Tesla product to date, even more than Roadster 2.

CyberTruck is pure utility. It exposes other trucks for effectively wearing makeup and trying to look pretty. There is not much function of curvy special stamped panels mounted to an internal frame, beyond aesthetics. So Tesla is not even trying to play in that rat race. 

The exoskeleton is very first principles. Maximize the function of the skin/body by making it double as the frame. There is almost no way to still make that cheap to manufacture AND look pretty, so they build all this sci-fi cyberpunk hype to glorify and celebrate its weird AF look.

I love it because they totally outflank the traditional game. It's so uncompromising, basically a big middle finger to consumer culture trucks masquerading as utility vehicles, destroying the ""ICE truck tough-guy"" marketing strategy that competitors rely on.

EDIT: I said *consumer* trucks, not work/contractor trucks. I understand workers may still prefer traditional open bed style so they can carry bigger racks and such. But most F150s today are not for work/contractor purposes. And  CyberTruck would probably still do pretty good as a work truck. Has a large 6.5ft bed, has the same freight attachment points used in airlift industry, can power electric and pneumatic power tools, has a fully enclosable and lockable bed for security, and if that's not enough, it could tow any custom work trailer.

post,drxr1f,,Plaid model s increase in top speed speculation/discussion.,"So the new Tesla model s plaid has been spotted around the Nurburgring quite a bit lately and is posting some impressive times. Now the Nurburgring has a pretty long straight and I think a Tesla shouldn’t have any issues reaching its top speed there. But if I’m not mistaken the current model s is limited to 220 kph (136 mph) (I was misinformed it is 262 kph/163 mph which is still a significant difference with the announced roadster specs) which seems quite slow compared to the top speed of other cars posting similar times. And the model s plaid will feature a very similar motor set up to the roadster which has a 400+ kph (250+mph) top speed according to Elon. Would it be safe to assume that the new plaid model s will be limited to a higher top speed compared to the current model s or are they running at the Nurburgring with a 220 kph (262kph) max top speed, Or would they have removed the top speed limit with software.

Also on a side note has the top speed of the taycan been announced? Seeing how it has 2 gears I would assume it could be higher but seeing how much every “improvement” over the model s get reported to death and I haven’t heard anything about this yet I would assume it’s top speed will not be that impressive. But I could be wrong I don’t follow the Porsche taycan that much and could have easily missed some news about it 

Apologies in advance if I completely missed an article that answered most if not all of these questions already, and if there is I would love a link to said article. Feel free to let me know your thoughts on this or correct me if I made any mistake in my stats or other assumptions.

post,dmgtsu,,The Pickup is absolutely going to change the game,"I’ve been thinking more about the pickup and I was recently [listening to an interview with Elon]( when something dawned on me. The pickup is going to absolutely change the automotive industry. Let me explain. When Tesla created the Model S, for all intents and purposes, it was just another car. What I mean is that to the layman, non-carguy type of person, the Model S didn’t stand out of the crowd. From 100 feet away it was just another car. And even when you knew it was electric, it wasn’t *that* big of a deal to most people. Why? Because over the last century, there have been numerous examples of “electric cars” whether they be concepts at auto shows or terrible attempts at actually building one. Electric *cars*. Not trucks. 

So we’ve had the S which looks like any other car, the X which looks like any other CUV (except when the falcon doors open) and the 3 which looks like any other car. Again, I’m talking about from the perspective of the average person. Even the old and new Roadsters aren’t a big deal because we’ve all seen “exotic cars” before. Yes I know the new Roadster is going to absolutely blow the doors off of everything on this planet but again, to the average person, it’s just another “Ferrari”. In fact, most people will probably mistake it for a Ferrari when they see it on the roads. Our brains are already used to seeing that type of vehicle. 

But we’ve never seen an electric Pickup truck before (correct me if I’m wrong). It’s such a departure from the conventional thinking. Pickup trucks are big noisy things that run on gasoline or diesel! Everybody knows that! You can’t make an electric truck! What about the torque! What about towing! What about range! That’s more or less the reaction I’ve seen from people inside the automotive industry. And to top it all off, Pickup trucks are by far the best selling vehicles in America. Americans fucking *love* pickup trucks. If you’ve ever been to Texas, you know what I’m talking about.

I rented a McLaren 720S for the weekend (I can answer questions if anyone is interested by any chance), what's amazing and shocking to me was getting back to my Model 3 afterwards it felt like a completely new car with a bunch of things I never noticed before:

1.	The seating position was amazing. It felt like driving a SUV with all the height and visibility I ever needed.

2.	The *seats* were amazing. The McLaren had these P1 bucket seats that's designed for either track drivers or extremely wealthy masochists. The Mode 3's seats were wide, power adjustable, heated and sitting on it was like sitting on cotton candies. It was glorious. I'll never complain about these seats again.

3.	For people who think the Model 3 handles sharp with a suspension that's on the firmer side, go drive a supercar like the 720S. In comparison driving my AWD Model 3 felt like...driving a pillow stuffed with cloud, in the best and worst way possible. 

4.	My Model 3's cabin insulation might as well be a Rolls Royce when compared to the 720S. It's good to be able to listen to music at less than max volume or talk to your passenger without raising your voice on the highway.

5.	The McLaren was getting something like 14 mpg on mixed highway/local driving (granted I wasn't exactly driving in an...economical manner), in contrast my Model 3 might as well be running on the anguish and tear of oil companies.

6.	The brakes in the Model 3 are much more sensitive and natural for daily driving, even discount the regen factor. The CC brakes on the McLaren was... well let's just say stepping on the brakes does almost nothing...then...still almost nothing... and then it does **EVERYTHING**. I almost made the cars behind me rear end me a few times by stepping on the brakes too hard after getting into my Tesla.

* Winch capable to pull it out of sticky situations
* Roll down back window for ventilating the vault when closed and for passengers accessing the cooler, etc. while driving
* Yellowstone super volcano air filtration (better than bio weapon defense).  The cyber truck is the ideal vehicle for driving through volcanic ash as there are few moving parts exposed to air and stopping does not require brakes. To prevent the cabin filter from clogging recirculate the interior air and close the air intake on the battery cooling system. Limit power as needed to keep battery within acceptable temps.

post,ebz4le,,Tesla Solar can't install on a 3 story house in NorCal,"I started the process with Tesla at beginning of October.  I figured that I may or may not make it before the end of the year but I figured I might as well try since I just closed on a new house and didn't really have any other choice.   Turns out when you have a new construction house it makes it difficult for solar companies because they don't have satellite pictures of your roof so they actually have to send someone out to look at your roof.  Makes sense.  

So I stay home from work one day to have telsa solar take a look at the roof, turns out the guy they sent out doesn't have the ability to look at a 3 story roof.  He checks out everything else like the attic and takes pictures of the things he could and said they would send someone else out in a few weeks with the equipment to get to the 3rd story roof.  On the 10th the same guy from before calls me to tell me that the guy with the special equipment came to look at my roof and the design team should be in contact with me soon.  Everything seemed to be going along great.  They even signed agreement with me that make sure if the install didn't go through at the end of the year they would give me the extra 4% as a rebate.  

Last friday they call me to tell me that they can't fit the large sized solar system on my roof but they could do a medium + 6 panels + 3 powerwalls instead.  I agreed to it and was excited for the project to finally get underway.  

This morning I get this email:

The graphs shown in the app under ""energy usage"" appear to be correct and match the stats from our power provider in terms of when we draw grid power. However, the figures with the graphs are not accurate - see example ""from grid: 8.9kWh"" when the graph shows we didn't draw any power from grid that day. Also not accurate are the ""self powered performance"" stats where it only shows the power drawn from solar and not power from the powerwall (despite the graph under energy usage correctly showing the house was powered solely via power and battery for the day).

So I'm a little worried about range while Towing with the CyberTruck. In the following I will explain exactly why and provide some counterpoints to my fears. In the conclusion I will ask for assistance!

First I will Provide my sources.

[TFLC Ep1]( ,
[TFLC Ep2]( ,
[Edmunds]( , 
[CarsGuide](

Now my fear is that the motors are going to just be model s/x and 3 variants tossed into this pickup for the sake of minimizing costs. Things are going to get a bit fuzzy at this point because I don't have hard numbers. I'll provide what I gathered for mostly model x towing.

In the table above Sources 1 and 2 are from the same people; 3 and 4 are also from the same person. So while there are 5 sources of data there are only 3 groups of people.

Here is my fear! The range reduction is pretty scary and seems to scale roughly linearly. Honestly the motors are so efficient I bet it scales damn near linearly if you can take into account all of the appropriate factors like wind resistance, altitude gain, and rolling friction.

I save about $200 a month doing this. To me that’s icing on the cake because my Powerwalls are primarily for backup. The Cybertruck’s 240V outlet got me thinking that even the base $39,900 car is basically **eight** Tesla Powerwalls on wheels. Tesla spent a ton of money and time on local permitting just to get my **two** Powerwalls installed. And they did it again with a different process for a buddy living just one city over, less than 5 miles away. That’s got to be a royal pain in the ass for tesla and a huge driver of costs. 

With Cybertruck, I could basically just install an automatic transfer switch with a NEMA 14-50 input and plug my truck’s 240V output in as hot backup if Tesla engineered it to support this. ANY licensed electrician could install an ATS at a house anywhere across the country relatively easily and at reasonable cost. 

If Tesla is smart they’d use Cybertruck to cannibalize their own Powerwall sales - hell just ax that product - and make Cybertruck an indispensable part of the home.

I was looking at the subscription model for Tesla solar and for 130-195/month, that seems like a fantastic deal. Does anyone here have any feedback they could provide? Is it too good to be true? Does this mean that my electricity bill will eventually be only the price of my monthly bill to Tesla? I charge 2 EV vehicles so I think it wouldn't help too much unless we're charging during the day? In that case, it would only save us about 50 dollars a month since that's how much we pay for off-peak electricity  (when we charge the cars).

Also, Has anyone rented the panels and purchased the powerwall? I wonder if there's an optimal configuration providing the best benefit for the least amount of cost. Thanks in advance!

post,dveedy,,Tesla Solar Experience,"Just wondering what other peoples' experiences have been with Tesla Solar? I know they were having customer service issues a while back, but was hoping they had been corrected or improved. I'm having extremely frustrating issues with them and am wondering if I should stick it out or cut my losses and cancel my order?

I live in Central California and placed an order with Tesla because I own a Model 3 and their quote was the best price of the four I received. However, there have been issues over a referral discount I was supposed to receive that I didn't. Tesla acknowledged this, but hasn't been able to rectify it. I've been bounced around to a bunch of different people who I can never get in touch with and who NEVER respond to emails or voicemails. It has been an exasperating and incredibly frustrating experience -- especially since I want to support the company and am such a big fan of Tesla Motors.

I'm now at the point where I'm close to just cancelling the whole deal. I'm just appalled at the lack of communication and customer service from Tesla. They are close to losing a $23K sale simply because they are inept at customer service.

Update:  Coincidentally, I finally heard back from Telsa a couple hours after posting the above.  They seem to have resolved the issue with the discount, but now they are telling me they can't guarantee my system will be installed and permitted by the end of the year, which was a condition of me originally signing a contract with them.  At the time, they said as long as there were no unforeseen issues with my roof or approvals -- which there haven't been -- the system would absolutely be installed and all permits in place well before the end of the year.  Now they're saying they can no longer guarantee that. They moved the goal posts on me!  In fairness, they still could get it done in time, but this is really disappointing.

post,dv4xtu,,Tesla Energy and Advertising,"I visited Monterey, CA this past weekend and was surprised — as an east coast resident — by how **few** homes I saw with solar panels in sunny California.  With Elon’s recent, “it’s like having a cash printing machine on your roof” statements regarding Tesla’s solar offering, I expected to see as many solar installations as I saw Teslas rolling around ... but I didn’t.

I frequent r/TeslaMotors enough to see the occasional, “Why doesn’t Tesla advertise?” post get thoroughly swatted down, but those are always talking about the _automotive_ side of Tesla, where the most common rebuttal is that the company is production constrained — _Tesla already cannot make enough cars to satisfy current demand, so why spend any money to create yet **more** demand?_

So, simple question, do we have evidence that Tesla **Energy** is similarly production constrained?  Has anyone ordered a Tesla solar install? What’s the current wait time?

Thank you!

Edit: To better direct the conversation — if Tesla Energy is **not** production constrained, then would it not make sense for Tesla Energy to advertise?",1573533335.0,2019-11-12 05:35:35,7,14,TheBurtReynold,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dv4xtu/tesla_energy_and_advertising/,True,0.7,2019,both,search,False,False,0,
post,drf0lg,,Tesla should sell managed solar power plants (incl. batteries) and deploy them themselves as well,"So you might have noticed that the transition to renewable energy is going rather slowly. Even if solar and wind (+batteries) are cost-competitive, many energy companies have invested heavily in fossil fuels and thus need to amortize their costs. This slows the necessary change down. To fast track it, Tesla should sell a complete solar power plant as a product, including battery storage.

This power plant would not only generate energy but also intelligently trade it on the energy market, utilizing its battery storage. This would not only produce another profit but actually stabilize the grid.

Tesla should also sell this in a “managed” version, like a server farm. Customers basically give Tesla money and get the profits in return. Tesla deploys, maintains, and manages the plant for them.

This would serve multiple ends:

* The adoption of renewable energy is fastened, as it becomes easier to invest in it. I could even imagine crowd-investing.
* The adoption of renewable energy is fastened, as it (further) demonstrates the economic viability of the concept.
* The cost of solar and batteries decreases because higher volumes are produced, thanks to the [Experience Curve effect](
* Tesla's mission is supported.
* The image of EVs is improved as the counter-argument of “EVs use fossil fuel electricity” is weakened.

Now, if Tesla sells a product that basically prints money and only needs some capital investment…what stops them from just deploying their own solar plants? Nothing!

Just as SpaceX creates its own demand for its new Starship by creating the Starlink network and out-competing its old customers (at least some of them), Tesla can create its own demand for batteries and solar. They just need some capital, and ta-da, money is printed. Since profit margins are internalized, Tesla gains an additional cost advantage.

As solar and battery technology is on an exponential trend ([ as soon as cost competitiveness is reached, Tesla can out-compete fossil fuels and forc",1572857742.0,2019-11-04 09:55:42,58,25,DarmokAndJaladAtTana,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/drf0lg/tesla_should_sell_managed_solar_power_plants_incl/,True,0.85,2019,both,search,False,False,0,

post,doo3ra,,Roof replacement frequency and how it affects solar roof,"On the recent web cast Elon was talking about some rough estimates on how many new roofs are built each year and how many roof replacements there are each year - the second figure was about 6 times higher than the first one if I recall correctly. Furthermore, he said that typically one replaces the roof every 25 years. When I heard that I was very surprised and I am even more surprised that no one here on reddit doubts about these numbers. Who replaces the roof once every 25 years?! In my country majority of roofs on single-family houses are made of clay ceramic tyles or from zink coated steel tyles. I admit that the metal tyles are less durable, but also cheaper, and might need replacing after maybe 50 years because of rust that eventually makes it way. But producers of the clay ceramic tyles say that they should last at least 100-150 years and actually I *never* heard of anyone replacing the roof made from this material (apart from the cases when a tornado destroyed the roof, but tornadoes are extremely rare over here). My house, built around 20 years ago has clay ceramic tyles roof and right now it's in pristine condition - it's basically like new, there's nothing in ceramic tyles that would degragate in this kind of time frame. There are a lot of very old houses with this kind of roof and it was never replaced. The concept of periodically replacing the roof sounds just very odd to me and because of that Elon's estimates sound bizarre. Is replacing roofs this often really a reality in the USA?

post,dnhc7u,,Solar Roof and HOA,"So were seriously considering the new Tesla Solar Roof in Southern California, as our home is also overdue for re-roofing. We had previously applied for Tesla’s solar panels (8.2kW), but got stalled because they wanted us to re-roof for an additional $8,000. The total price of the solar panel system plus re-roof was $36,000. The price of the Solar Roof is estimated at $40,000, but the tax credit is much larger and the total kW is also bigger (9.5kW), making it a no-brainer alternative. 

The only caveat is that we are part of a small community HOA and the Tesla Solar Roof looks nothing like the roof tiles of the entire neighborhood. California has a law that prohibits HOA’s from denying solar installations, regardless of HOA rules. We were thinking that we could basically use this law to justify the Solar Roof, and they wouldn’t have any legal recourse to fine us or prevent the installation. 

This might be more appropriate for the legaladvice subreddit, but we wanted to probe some Tesla-user thoughts on this situation, as there might be others in a similar position. Obviously we are going to talk to our HOA, but we wanted to go into talks as informed as possible.

Edit: roof tiles* not shingles.

post,dnf0io,,Thoughts on the Solar(Glass) Roof & Why Tesla Will Become A Global Energy Utility,"I wanted to take a minute to outline my thoughts of yesterday's announcement and the overall forward-looking guidance for the Solar Roof in 2020 (and beyond). But before I do, I just want to highlight something Elon said during the earning's call on Wednesday when discussing their new solar rental business: 

""...And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here which is effectively to become a giant distributed global utility..."". 

I don't think this statement was discussed once in any of the analyst calls or articles that were written following the Q3 call. I also don't think most investors or fans that follow the company understand what this means or the disruption that is happening right now within the energy markets and why existing energy utilities are fighting back, making it very difficult or impossible for you and your family to install solar and storage products in certain areas of the U.S. I'll digress here and share this link to an article written in 2017 that I think perfectly sums up what is going on and how Tesla is well-positioned to take advantage of the market transformation: 
 
The statement that Elon made implies Tesla Energy may have a bigger impact on the company's long-term success than automotive. I generally think this will be true. If you put aside the value proposition of autonomous vehicles and a resulting ride sharing network, it's very hard to justify Tesla's current market cap or future market cap based on the growth of auto sales. There has never been a $500 bn auto company and there likely won't ever be. There's too much competition and it's too difficult to scale to the point where you can dominate the market. Excluding Tesla, the entire market cap of the top 10 automakers in the world equals ~$400 bn. How much is the combined market cap for the top 10 energy utilities? $550 bn.

I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a ""paid big oil shill"" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.

Everything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.

And yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.

# EV performance & its accessibility

I'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the ""pure acceleration"" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.

And how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds.

post,rmbhqh,,My extensive Porsche Taycan Turbo Review,"My Model 3 AWD lease is about to end. While I generally have positive things to say about my Tesla experience, my Tesla hasn’t exactly been scratching my itches as a car enthusiast. So I am currently at a bit of a crossroads, buy another Tesla and get an affordable-ish sports car. Or combine the funds into one nicer vehicle. 

The problem with the one nicer vehicle is the fact that it does need to be EV. While I am sure a lot of great EV vehicles will burst onto the scene in the next three years, there’s really only one car on the market currently that feels like it might be an upgrade from my Tesla while also satiating my enthusiast desires and that is the Porsche Taycan. 

Now I’ll be honest in saying that I am by no means a Porsche fan. I drove a 997 911 Turbo as well as a 718 Cayman base and I walked away from both cars feeling like they were sports cars on Xanax. They just weren’t exciting for me. 

Likewise, I am by no means a Tesla fanboy. I think they have EV offerings that make a lot of sense, but as a car enthusiast I do long for something that feels a bit more special. 

Unfortunately when reading comparisons between Tesla’s and Taycan’s they pretty quickly devolved into descriptions that felt too simple to me. “If you want a well built car with a great driving experience get the Taycan” “If you want a good charging network, like technology, and need lots of range get a Tesla” While I knew both of those general sentiments to be inherently true, I felt like they were leaving out a lot of details and that the folks righting these statements were inherently pro Tesla or pro Taycan making it hard to find what felt like an unbiased opinion. 

Fortunately I found myself on vacation and in a position to rent a Porsche Taycan Turbo from Turo so I jumped on the opportunity to see whether it would be more compelling than another Tesla and a dedicated sports car. Here are my thoughts below:

The next summer, visiting family in the Caribbean when I was 11, I got a chance to ride a Honda Lead and then learned sequential shifting on a 125cc Cub. On the same trip, My uncle taught me to drive his 5-speed Nissan Sunny (mostly I think so he could drag me to his Rotary Club meetings and get rum drunk, and I could nervously poke us back to the house at about 30kph in 2nd gear while he sang at the top of his lungs.)

Within a year of that, I was at the library obsessing about the story of Lee Iacocca and the ‘64 1/2 Mustang then deciding I wanted a ‘68 fastback, and then settling on a ‘69 Boss 302, or 429, or you know, at least a Mach 1. Never did get the Mustang, but have owned and driven and ridden in/on a huge variety of different cars, trucks and bikes in the ensuing 30 years. What I’d never driven or really experienced in all that time was a BMW.

I’d ridden in a cousin’s clapped out E21 3 Series as a littlun, and partially the fact that it was more rattling subwoofer than car (complete with Benzi Box and “NO / RADIO!” sticker), and partially that I was (incredibly uncomfortably) sat on someone’s lap, I was too young to appreciate anything special about it other than it was loud, rattly and scary.

I always carried that with me. Bimmers were Cars for Assholes™️, and anyone that drove one was probably a sociopath, or at least compensating for some terrible lack of parental love as a child.

Let's start with the bad about the Model Y. First, the suspension. The Model Y is a very firm vehicle, it's not like a cushion or a pillow ride like some air suspension vehicles have. My friend has a Q8, which is way better than my Model Y. Another bad is the road-trip ability/charging. The supercharger network is praised upon by many people transitioning to Tesla vehicles but in my experience, it's been a mixed bag. I never felt like I would run out of range and always made it to my destination/supercharger with at least 10% battery. Supercharging is annoying. I made a trip to Houston and back in my Model Y and there are 3 charging stops along the way. The way it's mapped you have 2 options. If you stop at the first charger (Corsicana TX) you would have to stop at the 3rd Charger (Huntsville TX) otherwise you wouldn't make it. You may be thinking ok just go to the charger in the middle and have one-stop. That's even worse because Tesla only put 4 stalls at that location. On the way to Houston, I had 4 cars AHEAD of me. I waited 30 min just to get a spot, it was fine 25 min and I'd be on my way. I was kinda annoyed because a trip that takes 4 hrs 30 took close to 5 and a half hours pretty much. On the way back I figured I'd go to the outer two chargers, guess what happened, another wait, at both. The first one was a 15-minute wait then a 10-minute charge. The second one was a 10-minute wait with a 10 min charge. I guess a pro of taking the Tesla vs my Lexus was the charging was free, I got 2,000 free supercharging miles when I bought my vehicle.

post,ohoh4i,,The Physics of 0-60 mph in 2 Seconds (Model S Plaid),"I was looking into the physics of the Tesla Model S Plaid's performance numbers in response to the [discussion]( and [debate]( going on in r/cars but I thought you all would find this insightful too. Tesla's claims of 0-60 mph in 1.99 seconds, 1/4 mile in 9.23s @ 155 mph are all very impressive and seemingly defying the laws of physics. No worries though, I built a physics-based model for performance EVs, plugged in the Model S Plaid, and confirmed the universe is still in order.

Let's start with some interesting takeaways from the model first and I'll go into detail on the physics and how it was built later on.

# Model S Plaid is built for 0-60 in 2 seconds

Modern EV motors all have a similarly shaped power curve that have a constant torque region (lower speeds) and a constant power region (higher speeds). **Peak acceleration occurs in the constant torque region** and acceleration is constant until you hit the ""corner speed"" and transition into the constant power region where torque drops off.

The power curve of the Model S Plaid has just the right shape (and peak power/torque) to reach 60 mph in 2 seconds (excluding a 1ft rollout). As evidence, the **Model S Plaid has a corner speed of exactly 60 mph** (ie. 1050 ft-lb is 1020 hp at a vehicle speed of 60 mph). This allows it to pull a constant \~1.25 g's all the way up to 60 mph, which falls off immediately after ([plot](

To get to 60 mph even faster, the Model S Plaid would need to have even more torque (and probably more traction). Just **having more power wouldn't yield 0-60 improvements as the Model S Plaid** **is already in its constant torque region all the way up to 60 mph**. Higher peak power would just allow it to maintain its constant acceleration up to a higher corner speed, which would only reduce 1/4 mile times. However, (as u/Frazeur pointed out) **increasing the final drive ratio would increase peak acceleration and improve 0-60 mph time**. While this does reduce the corner speed, overall accele",1625943067.0,2021-07-10 20:51:07,11,16,jayqwu,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ohoh4i/the_physics_of_060_mph_in_2_seconds_model_s_plaid/,True,0.6,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I don't drive own a car nor do I have much interest in them, until Tesla came on the scene. I started watching the Tesla youtubers and of late more mainstream channels have been making videos about Tesla and EVs in general. 

Under every single one of these videos there's always the one person who goes ""Well electricity is made from coal and battery manufacturing is very carbon intensive"" 

So lets do the math to see if that holds up. for the purposes of this thought experiment were going to be comparing an EV sedan to an ICE sedan.

# Manufacturing

This [paper]( puts CO2 figure for the manufacture of an ICE car at 9.2 tons.   
This [article]( puts the figure for a Tesla Model 3 at about 12 tons but lets round up to 15 just to make things interesting.

According to the [ICCT]( an Average Daimler car of a mass of 1552 KG produces 137 grams of CO2 per KM. 

A Tesla Model 3 LR uses about 15 KWH for 100 KM that means it uses about 150 WH per KM. According to the [EIA]( Right now in the US 500 g of CO2 is emitted to produce 1 KWH of energy( this is way lower in Europe). So 1 KWH of energy  emits 500g  of CO2 . So our model 3 emits 75 g of CO2 per Km. 

Theres a carbon impact to refining and transporting fuel. This [study]( puts the well to tank emissions of 1litre of petrol at 636 grams per litre. Lets assume that a comparable sedan to the model 3 gets 15 KM/L. that puts the an additional 42 grams per Km.

&#x200B;

So the EV emits 75 G per km and the ICE car emits 179 per km. 

The average person drives 23,000 km per year in the US. 

So that means in one year the EV emits 1.7 tons of CO2. The ICE car emits 4.1 tons of CO2. 

This means that the EV will offset its higher manufacturing footprint in 2 years of driving. 

Also there's also the fact that EV batteries can be recycled and repurposed into new batteries or into stationary storage which brings down their carbon footprint even more.

post,mudcnh,,What would happen to an electric car in a major pile up?,"Reading about the Tesla crash that required thousands of gallons of water to put out and the 100+ car pile up in Dallas in February has got me wondering. If an electric car was to be caught in a multi-car pile up, how would it fare compared to gas cars? I know electric cars are really good in crash tests, but that's only in one accident. What happens if the vehicle's structure is already compromised and then you get an 18-wheeler barreling into it at over 60 mph smashing it into everything else? If Trey McDaniel was in a Model X or Mach E and it got ejected into the next lane over, that seems like a best case scenario should it burst into flames. How will you get enough water to drown the batteries and keep them from reigniting if the car is now in the middle of the group (assuming fire fighters can get to the scene early and close enough)?

post,m01wde,,The Best 2021 Volvo S60 is Underpriced,"Here’s the scenario: you’re interested in getting a compact luxury sports sedan, and you’re thinking about treating yourself to something that’s really quite nice. The usual Teutonic names come into play here: Mercedes, Audi, BMW, along with some others: Tesla, Genesis, etc. And then you think about looking into Volvo’s offerings - which you end up getting, because it’s so terribly mispriced compared to the competition.

Here’s a bunch of MSRPs (which, I know, isn’t what people will actually pay at the dealer, but nonetheless is a solid benchmark) for mostly-comparably-equipped sedans: all wheel drive, a heads-up display, automated parking, traffic-aware cruise control, a sunroof, and whatever free seats/paint color/wheels were available. You might have different preferences than I do, so the numbers might vary person-to-person.

* Volvo’s S60 Recharge Inscription is basically the best S60 you can buy. It comes standard with basically everything, to the point where the only option worth adding (at least, for someone living in Texas) is the $200 automatic parking feature. MSRP + Destination comes out to $51,895, for a 400-horsepower plug-in hybrid with AWD. It also comes with a tax credit of $5,419, making the “actual” price $46,476 (for those who qualify, and I assume most people buying these kinds of products qualify).
* Genesis’ G70 3.3T AWD came to $49,225. It lacked the heads-up display, but was otherwise well-equipped and easily one of the higher-value plays available.
* Tesla’s Model 3 Long Range AWD was $47,190. There aren’t many options available, but it’s easily the most tech-focused product, which causes some polarization among shoppers.
* Audi’s A4 Prestige 45 TFSI quattro S tronic (what a mouthful!) also comes equipped well without having to select options, so it tips the scales at $50,845. The A4 has 261 HP, so about 35% less power to show off four rings. The sportier S4 starts at $50,945 and goes up to $59,245 for the top trim.

This is a long post, and is rated PG-13.

Outgoing 2018 CX-5: I’ll miss the [candy]( [apple]( [red]( exterior, and the [cream]( interior.
Incoming 2018 Mustang: [Orange]( [Mustang]( [Convertible]( 

**Brief History:**
I bought the CX-5 primarily for the higher seating position - was in a [white 2016 Honda Civic]( before that - and secondarily for the gorgeous Soul Red, in the Touring trim with the Preferred package. The CX-5 was great for roadtrips, minor off-roading (read: non-paved roads in national parks), being very visible on the road to other drivers, had a robust safety suite (forward collision warning, blind spot monitors, rear cross-traffic alert - but no parking sensors for the 2018 Touring), and the candy apple red was a remarkable conversation piece. At the time it was a great deal and good value for the money (~$34k OTD).

The hankering for a convertible hit me when I saw a Mercedes-Benz drop its top at a stop light. The morning was sunny, wind was pleasant, outside temp was a breezy 70 (Fahrenheit). The idea - once taken root - never quite let go from 2019. I opened the sunroof on the CX-5 at most available opportunities anyhow so I began my… 

**Research:**
I didn’t take action until the CX-5 was paid off (and driven nearly [46k miles]( , but once it was I began looking. Unfortunately the pandemic was (is?) in full swing, and used car prices were (are) through the proverbial roof - more so for convertibles (pun intended :D).

I didn’t consider any Germans because I rode the ‘Germans expensive when broken’ bandwagon - although:
 
* Carmax had quite a few tempting offers for Audi A5 convertibles, and my friend swears by 2017+ Audis for their reliability
* Now that I know of Mercedes’ Airscarf technology’s existence not only am I curious to try it, but also wonder if the take rate for convertibles is too low for other manufacturers to incorporate similar technology into their offerings

post,reu1b9,,First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure),"**Backstory**

I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles.

&nbsp;

Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used).

&nbsp;

Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. 

&nbsp;

**Motor Failure** 

Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure]( and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable]( and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car.

post,pupybk,,"Desperate need of help! Rat got in my car, Tesla and independent shops don't want to help.","So for the last couple of days I have been beating my brains out trying to resolve this issue.

Vehicle: 2021 Tesla Model Y

A couple of days ago, a rat somehow got into my car.  I am guessing that it got into my backpack at work then got into the car after.  I noticed rat droppings and urine in the trunk area the following day.  In the evening while at work, I sat in my car to see if I could hear any rustling, which I did.  I tried looking for it but it would hide in an area I don't have easy access to.

I went ahead and bought several traps, both traditional clamps and glue traps plus bait; however, they have been unsuccessful.

Last night, I sat in my car again to see if I could hear it but I could not.   This worries me now because I don't know if it escaped the vehicle or if it's dead somewhere in the car where I can't find it.

I contacted Tesla to see if they would be able to inspect the crevices and panels but they said they consider this to be a hazmat issue so they refused to do it.

I contacted my insurance to make a comprehensive claim and they referred me to local body shops.  I had to filter through these body shops to make sure they are Tesla certified; however, every single place I called said that they won't deal with a rat infestation and that I should contact Tesla directly, which I already did.

I went ahead and made a claim with my insurance but I am worried that they won't be able to find a Tesla-certified body shop that would do this kind of work to begin with.

So between having a rat driving partner and the lack of available services, I am really stressed out.

post,o6z52n,,Helped my mother finally get her dream Ford Mustang. (Mach-E),"(Apologies for the long-winded story.)

My mom has been a consistent four door sedan owner for the entirety of my life and has been very anti-SUV/crossover.  There were more Ford Tauruses in her ownership history than either of us could remember.  Her last sedan was a 2016 Volvo S60, and she enjoyed that well enough, but she often complained about how low it was.  With age starting to get to her knees, she started talking a lot more about SUVs and ease of entry/exit in the last few years, and especially in the last few months.

We started looking seriously at things in the past month or so.  She was really keen on the idea of a plug-in hybrid, but unfortunately the market where we live is virtually non-existent.  I don't think there's really been a PHEV sold regularly here since the Volt (which I had), and never a small SUV/crossover.  I looked around and pretty much everything came up 250-500 or more miles away, just way outside the feasible range for her to look at.  There was one random Rav4 Prime around that I don't know why or how a dealer here has it, but they also had it marked up $6k, so it was out.  She liked the idea of a full BEV as well, but it still made her a bit nervous, despite being around them for about 6 years between the Teslas my brother, and I have owned.  The Model Y was out of her price range by about $10k, give or take, and she never was fully comfortable with the interfaces and such in our Teslas, so I just knew it wouldn't be a good fit for her anyway.  It seemed like either a plain hybrid or the standard ICE variant of something like an Escape or CR-V was probably going to be in her future just due to what we could find.

However, my dad and I did have one other electric option left we were pursuing in our search for her, availability was just a huge issue.  I had talked to her about the Mach-E a lot from when it was first announced, because I knew it would be right up her alley.  She has a heavy bias towards Ford, and they've managed to ",1624534798.0,2021-06-24 13:39:58,41,35,Algeradd,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/o6z52n/helped_my_mother_finally_get_her_dream_ford/,True,0.68,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,n1bxsm,,Overnight test drive on Model Y,"Yesterday I picked up a Model Y Performance for an overnight test drive and I figured I’d put my quick thoughts here since the Tesla subreddit flames anything that’s not pure praise. 

The car has some significant flaws, but also does some things well. I went through it to check the quality and it was as expected (trash), different panel gaps everywhere, my A pillar trim was coming off, body panels felt thin, UI crashed while we were browsing it in a parking lot and power cycled, Autopilot almost hit the curb two or three times. I’m picky with cars I buy, always has to be the right spec even if it takes months, so I wouldn’t be able to live with this level of build. A current gen Acura, Mazda, Lexus all have significantly better fit and finish than this $60k Model Y. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the pickup and the handling. We’re a household that only buys M and AMG cars, last ones being the M2 and C63S, and if the car had better seat bolstering it would be pretty fun to drive in canyons, on par with those imo. The initial launch is slow, less aggressive than ICE cars but I think it’s intentionally mapped that way for traction. But the pickup between 25-75 is nice and really pulls. After around 85-90 is dies down and most other performance cars would pull on it easily. 

One of the parts I was most impressed by was the object recognition on the ADAS side. It would pickup most everything I passed, cones and trash cans too. I liked the little chime it does when lights turn green, and the 3D renders were decent. They’re no where near FSD as autopilot itself is flakey but it’s a start. 

Pros:
- Quick
- Handles decently
- No gas money
- Better than other $50k EVs 
- theater and games on display are nice
- highway LKA is pretty good

Cons:
- Garbage quality
- UI not intuitive 
- Software not completely stable 
- Autopilot kinda sucks anywhere except the highway

I see pros and cons to both sides. While I would love to utilize ADB headlights in my own car within the states, I'd also like to see bugs/flaws ironed out in terms of regulation. Perhaps moving too quickly with a new feature that has a fatal design flaw internally or externally with another regulation.

As for no side mirrors, the Cybertruck/Roadster are rumored to have side mirrors (with the pre-production concept versions having none) that are removable by the user by using a loophole within the system.

That said, this is both a LONGFORM and serious/informative post, so if you're only here to make snarky comments without reading, you're better off going elsewhere. That said...

Yes, you read the title right; after owning a Tesla Model 3 for a year, I've decided to ditch it for of all things, a Mini Clubman. Here's what I learned over my year of Model 3 ownership, broken up into pros/cons:

&#x200B;

Pros:

1. The Model 3 is a *superbly* engineered car. The engineers, both hardware and software, very clearly know their stuff. Range is great, and the car is pretty athletic. Straight line speed for the LR was more than anyone could reasonably need, and the steering was extremely direct for a car of its size. The suspension felt a tad sloppy at times, but overall was well enough sorted. There's tons of tech, and it's all easy to use. All of that coming in at a reasonable (for its segment) price? It's a no brainer, and from a technical standpoint, is probably one of the best all-around dailies you can buy. *It's that impressive.*
2. On to the tech... it's brilliant. The one screen to rule them all approach may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it works, and it works very well. After about a week, I could confidently navigate effectively everything I had to use regularly with just a glance to the controls - way, way better than many other infotainments I've used, where common functions are hidden under menus, UI isn't thought out, and responsiveness is... meh. Tesla's app is easy to use, reliable, and is feature packed. Combine that all with regular OTA updates, and over the course of the year I can definitely say my Model 3 was better than when I got it. It's pretty darn cool to have a car that's improving over the course of ownership.

post,r3vrqu,,What are cars that survived longer than people would think?,"I think the Miata takes the cake for me. It's shocking that the Miata outlasted the Evo and the Celica. That's really surprising when you think about the way the market has shifted. Cars have gotten a lot larger over the last thirty years since the Miata was introduced and the Evo was a sedan.

You would think the Evo would be around far longer than the little roadster but somehow the Miata has just kept ticking while a lot of other Japanese sports cars have fallen away.

I feel like the Mustang is another obvious one. It's quite surprising that it stuck around while the Camaro and Firebird disappeared. Obviously, the Mustang is the true pony car but it doesn't feel all that different from the Camaro to me.

I remember being a kid back in the 2000s and hearing about the Bugatti Veyron. I thought it was such an incredible thing. 16 cyliners? 1,000 horsepower? Over ONE MILLION dollars? I thought it was absolutely amazing. The styling was outrageous as well. I even got a chance to see one in person at an auto show.

There are a lot of other cool ones like the F1, P1, the Enzo, or the LaFerrari. But now it seems like every single manufacturer nowadays wants to make so many ""uLtRa RaRe, ULtRa sPeCiAL"" cars. We have the McLaren Senna, Senna GTR, Senna LM, Elva, Speedtail, the Lamborghini Reventon, Veneno, Centenario Coupe, Centenario Roadster, Sian, the new Countach, Vision GT, the Aston Martin Shooting Brake, Lagonda Taraf, One:77, and many of Bugatti's one-off models. And I haven't even scratched the surface. There are so many more that I haven't listed.

The new Countach, in my opinion, is the worst example of this. It's just a Sian/Aventador with 30 more horsepower, a body kit, and a redesigned interior. It doesn't have a manual, and doesn't add any value to Lamborghini's lineup in terms of specs, features nor performance. Just a lazy nostalgia-bait cash grab.

It feels like another one of these dumb things comes out every single week. And when it does, I feel indifferent at best. NONE of them feel special anymore.

post,oadwdj,,"0-60 doesn't tell the full story, let's compare the Plaid Model S's 60-130mph time.","On the surface, a 1.99-2.2s (depends on how you measure it) 0-60mph time is absurdly quick, but doesn't seem like a material leap from 2.2-2.4s achieved by previous record holders (918 Spyder, Model S Performance, Taycan Turbo S, etc). 

But what Tesla truly achieved with the Plaid powertrain is how much quicker it is at higher speed acceleration. So I'm doing a short list of comparing the Plaid Model S to some of the quickest accelerating cars ever built in history, EV and ICE alike. 

Note: I used magazine test time whenever possible for all the cars below, and drag strip timeslips if magazine test numbers are not available, and finally user submitted Draggy/Vbox times (this is when it gets unreliable).

Test: 60-130mph

2011 Ferrari F1: [~2.6s]( (purely for reference, current F1 cars are much faster even, but I can't find data).

2021 Rimac Nevera: [3.39s]( **Lol WTF BBQ, I guess sets a target for the future Roadster to beat**

2021 Bugatti Chiron Sport: [4.1s]( (I don't think we'll see a pure ICE production car exceeding this ever again).

2021 McLaren 765LT (ECU tune): [4.16s]( (only non-stock car on this list, but the modification is minimal and only shows how much McLaren sandbagged their turbo cars like usual).

**2021 Tesla Plaid Model S**: [4.71s](

2021 McLaren 765LT (stock):  [4.76s]( 

2013 McLaren P1: [4.8s]( (this was mind bogglingly fast when it came out 8 years ago)

2021 Ferrari SF90: [4.97s](

2013 Ferrari LaFerrari: [5s]( 

2017 McLaren 720S: [5.37s]( (for a mainstream supercar, this was a performance landmark when it first came out 4 years ago)

2020 Ferrari F8: [6.21s](

2021 Porsche 992 911 Turbo S: [6.7s](

**2019 Porsche Taycan Turbo S**: [8.1s]( (the previous king of production EVs)

**2020 Tesla Model S Performance (Raven)**: [9.4s](

After owning a CR-Z for a short time span, i managed to find my absolute dream car (of which, there are only a few in europe) for a reasonable price. Hence, i present you my very own [2006 Daihatsu Copen 1.3]( Probably the car with the largest smile in the world, at least in proportion to its [ridiculous small size](

The car itself is a has a curb weight of 830kg, and is designed to be a Japanese kei-car. This means, it had originally a 660cc twin-scroll turbocharged engine. Due to higher interest than anticipated in Europe,  they made a European version with a 1.3l NA engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission which produced an ~~incredible~~ 87ps and a redline of 6'800 (the 660cc has a redline of 8000rpm!). The 87ps and 120nm is sent to the front wheels.   
The folding roof is made out of aluminum and folds automatically, besides two latches, into the trunk for sunny weather. The trunk is usable but quite small as the maximum cargo load (including passenger!) is only 150kg.

Now for the interesting part, how it drives. It should be mentioned that the Copen has two completely different handling profiles. On the one hand, when the roof is closed, it drives like a FWD hot hatch, which is extremely low to the ground (\~100mm stock ground clearance, lower than everything else!) with a direct and manual feeling due to no electronic assistance besides ABS (and of course, no rev hang or fake sound). Nevertheless, always manageable to drive with a true neutral behavior, if applied throttle a slight understeer and somehow comfortable with A/C and heated seats. The Copen even managed to get up to 200km/h on the Autobahn back when the borders were open, that's were he runs into the rev limiter. The spoiler does a good job keeping the rear planted.

Won this in an auction last week. In the world of Datsun Roadsters this is THE unicorn. First model year of the 2000 (2L vs the 1.6L engine of the 1600) and the only 2000 model with a low windshield. The windshield height was raised in 1968 and on due to safety regulations. The low windshield models are much more desirable due to the much better looking proportions. The 2000 roadster upon it's release pretty much put every other car in it's class to shame, from Triumph to MG. Paul Newman actually started his racing career in a 2000 Roadster.

This particular one ALSO has all the rare competition package options: Solex Mikuni carbs, ""B"" cam, and the rare large capacity aluminum oil pan. The competition package bumps the 135hp up to 150hp. This version of the 2000 was only produced for half a year, and as such from my understanding there are estimated to be less than 500 produced, and only \~250 of these have been accounted for. A few people on the Datsun message boards have reached out to me and the common sentiment has been that this is one of the most complete original 67.5 2000's they've seen pop up in many many years, right down to some absolutely impossible to obtain trim pieces that were unique to just the 67.5.

post,rs8ypd,,Five Months with a 1995 Chevy S10: A Victim of Expectations,"&#x200B;

In the world of small, dependable trucks, there are many names that come to mind, the Toyota Hilux, the , and the Chevy S10 are all on the list. However, looking at a list of these trucks based on their off-road abilities yields a different result. The first two continue to dominate trails to this day but S10s have carved out a much different audience. Over the last five months I made the attempt to bridge the gap between mini truckin’ and off-roading with my 1995 Chevy S10 hoping that S10s are far from the trail because other people are stupid. I quickly learned it was I who was stupid.

My expertise in the automotive world spans far but the off-roading category is something that is rather new to me. I jumped on the overlanding mania a bit late and had to take time learning even the most basic parts of the activity like locking differentials, A/T’s vs M/T’s, different types of lifts, and much more. All I had was pride in the fact that I could easily explain the difference between AWD and 4WD. On the other hand, I am an expert in the realm of the S10. I've wanted an S10 ever since my previous attainable car, a Datsun 510, became very unattainable for a 10 year-old me with no mechanic skills. For a long time, I strove to find the perfect 1993 S10 with a single cab, the Vortec V6, a 5-speed manual, and rear-wheel drive. My plan was to have a starter drift truck and eventually do an engine swap. Finding a V6 single cab proved to be difficult and my interests wandered but I had built up a wealth of knowledge on the S10 that was unrivaled by anyone but the most feared moderators on s10forum.com. When I got to the point where I could actually afford a vehicle, my interests were in the world of off-roaders which led me to buy my 1995 S10 with the ZR2 off-road package. 

The ZR2 package is much better known today for its existence on the Chevy Colorado and the Silverado but the package first appeared in 1994 on the S10. It was also available on the 2-door Blazer o",1640890047.0,2021-12-30 19:47:27,2,6,tatertot464,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/rs8ypd/five_months_with_a_1995_chevy_s10_a_victim_of/,True,0.56,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,r1vimx,,Anyone had any weird or interesting car-related dreams? Had one myself this morning I thought was worth sharing,"I had a super weird car-related dream this morning and thought It was worth sharing..

I was out doing a paper round in the early morning (something i haven’t done in about 10 years), when I came across a very lovely looking house. It was tremendously clean top to bottom. Bright white wood slats framed its slate gray roof, with walls the same bright, lab-coat white. My eyes scanned across the front of the house, where I saw a blonde woman doing something with somme flowers at the corner of the front garden. It was then I noticed that parked on the driveway to the left of this front garden, was this absolutely stunning, [pearl white Lexus LFA]( So In my excitement I jogged up to the end of her front garden, looking over the white picket fence to where she was kneeling and said ""hey! nice car!"". The woman looked up and stared at me like I wasn't the first person to say this, and that she wasn't a fan of anyone who did. We were locked in an awkward stare for a few long, long seconds. I was thinking that maybe I'd offended her somehow, or that maybe she was just stuck up and didn't like people talking to her about the car?

Just then, a middle-aged man, quite tall and well kept looking, came over from the other side of the two car driveway (the other car was something like a blue Alpine a110, but i'm not completely sure). He was much much more friendly and open than his wife was. ""Oh that's mine!"" he cheered, and then of course immediately invited me in for dinner, as you do, to a stranger, at 8am. Much to the annoyance of his jaded seeming wife I should add.

Well cut to later on in our dinner conversations, sat around this rather small round dinner table, placed bang on in the middle of their fancy marble-adorned kitchen.

Can I buy any material brake pads regardless of what my car has had in the past? I.e. ceramic pads after running semi metallic, or vice versa. 

First brake pad change for the car, should I change the rotors? Rockauto suggests this will increase the pad life, and I have no way of inspecting my rotors before handing off the car to the mechanic. 


Context:

The car has about 56000km on it and the brake pads have been squeaking for a while now. I’m not sure if it’s front or rear but my mechanic told me to just buy both sets and he’ll take care of the rest. 

I spent a long time researching what pads to buy and narrowed it down to Akebono and Centric brake pads. 

I’m leaning Centric C-teks ceramics because they’re close to half the price of Akebono’s comparables, coming to around 70$ (excl shipping) for all 4 pads. If I get the rotors this will be closer to 200$. 

Am I making a good choice of pads? And are the rotors necessary/suggested or just an upsell considering the low mileage on the car?",1637693440.0,2021-11-23 19:50:40,2,14,Moh4565,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/r0k7ha/2017_limited_rav4_need_advice_on_brake_pads/,True,0.63,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ql5ee7,,Parking car in the sun,"Hello all,

Just looking for some advice or at least enough people to shout some sense at me.

Wife and I are are in the beginnings of buying a condo in the city. There’s a place we are both very interested in. Only catch for me is it doesn’t have any covered or garage parking. Parking outside isn’t inherently a problem for me. The car has lived outside for most of its life but coincidentally it’s either been shaded very nicely and for the last 4 years semi covered. But still outside.

The place we’re looking at has parking spots against the west wall of the building so for half the day it’s not getting any sun. But then when the sun crosses the edge of the building it will be getting absolutely roasted by the sun until it sets as there aren’t any tall buildings to the west or south. 

Again, not worried about the weather but just what the sun is going to do to the paint. We’re also talking about a focus st, nothing fancy or expensive. Color is blue. 

I’m currently investigating with the hoa of the building if they would allow me to put up a very basic car port. That would solve the stress for me. Other advice is just to make sure it’s cleaned and waxed regularly. Internet tends to agree covers are not a long term solution as they can often do more harm than good if you’re constantly taking them off and on. However, im thinking a cover might be a possible solution as we generally only need the car for bigger grocery trips or getting out to the suburbs. 

So am I crazy and need to get over this or are my fears warranted?",1635863207.0,2021-11-02 15:26:47,20,26,Ltjenkins,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ql5ee7/parking_car_in_the_sun/,True,0.88,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

It will be my third G8 and second GXP. It was a one owner who bought it from a Pontiac dealership in the Seattle area and only drove during the summer. It has 70k on the clock and is in immaculate condition. It is and auto PBM with, interestingly, no sunroof. It has a Rotofab CAI on it and a can tune. The interior feels brand new. I plan on keeping this long term and treating it as a semi-collector car that gets driven. It’s our second car and will be treated as such. PPI revealed nothing but new tires needed and new TPMS sensors.

First order of business is paint correction and protection. I’m not sure how far down the modification path I want to go since I’d like to keep it original but I do like to go fast. So that’s a hard one to resolve. Any suggestions?

anyway, it’s good to be back!

post,pv64wy,,What's the most disappointing car you've driven?,"Thought this makes for an interesting follow up from yesterdays question around the worst car.

My most disappointing was a base PDK Porsche Boxster (sorry Porsche fans). I turoed this car in Portland and it just felt like a sports car on Xanax. Wasnt that pleasant cruising down the highway and all the controls and inputs, and sounds just felt muted so wasn't that fun on a backroad either. 

I put Porsche on a pedestal before trying this one and was sorely whelmed. The basics feel like they're there, but just needs a higher spec model or mods to unearth it whereas a car like a Miata is fun right out the box. That said, a GT3/4 is still one of my semi-reasonable dream cars lol 

Some other disappointments:

- Fiesta ST: the transmission was pretty sloppy despite the handling being on point, interior was one of the worst I'd been in)

- Base Mustang GT: didn't have high expectations but man this thing was just a boat - really touchy brakes made it hard to drive smooth, the coyote was a bit obnoxious and the handling and throttle just all had a lag to it, a GT350 tho is my favorite car I've driven so far so the platform has potential for sure

- Jaguar XF 2.0: initially rented this on SF but boy was it slow and uninspiring. I drove it all of 10 miles before ""upgrading"" it for a challenger 5.7 r/t.

post,pmwrs7,,How it feels to drive the slowest vehicle on the road ? A 1982 Mitsubishi truck.,"I saw a post yesterday about someone doubting whether their 04 civic will do in highway. I drive a much slower vehicle. A 1982 3.5  tone Mitsubishi truck. I would say it can be compared in size to a modern 3500 series American truck. The plot twist however is that it is powered by a 4 cylinder NA diesel. I drive it for work. This thing will do 70 KPH (43.5MPh)  in good stretch of road. 

SO one might ask how can someone survive and how does it feel. 

First, forget about highways. I have never touched a highway and probably never will. However, I have been to roads where speed limits were 100KMH (62MPH). Of course I stay at the furthest right lane. surprisingly, People are not angry that I am going under speed limit. I guess they expect that from a similar vehicle. I did however get passed by aggressively by some vehicles in one way roads. I do stop for cars to pass if I am in single way. 

Passing other vehicles, the second thing you need to forget about. During the first or second day of me driving for this job, there was a loaded semi truck to my left. I said no way I am waiting behind that. We were both at a traffic light and I went to the left of the semi ( the faster lane). Fast forward, the green light opens and I accelerate at WOT shifting gears as fast as possible. We were about the same pace and I couldn't return to the slow lane. The semi truck driver saw my struggle and let off gas to allow me to go back to the right lane. Didn't try to pass anyone after that incident. 

Momentum driving, this is the best way to keep up with traffic. For example, when I approach a roundabout, I try to look into it from a distance and enter at the right time so I don't come to a stop before the roundabout. Within a safe limit. 

To conclude, a modern slow car can go through most situations you face in the road. Especially if you are alert to your surroundings. You have to calculate situations before everyone and adjust your driving to that.

post,p61t6e,,Braking distances of different types of vehicles,"Hi,

I just remembered an old article in a trucking magazine from 2014 and thought that you guys would be interested in hearing about it. It's disappointingly short considering all the info they could have gotten out of it and presented, but well.

The magazine is Finnish, so the units are all metric, but I'll try to convert them so that you Americans have an easier time. Also, since there are apparently different types of tons, or tonnes, used around the world, here 1 t = 1000 kg.

Also, sadly, the magazine did not report specific vehicle brands or models, or even weights (with a few exceptions), but I think the article still has an important/interesting message. The brake tests were done from 80 km/h (49.7 mph) to 0 (80 km/h is the maximum speed limit of trucks, and probably the most common speed limit in Finland).  The weather was nice and sunny and the tarmac was dry (normal road tarmac). I don't know what temperature it was. All vehicles had ABS except the bike (I think).

The most important braking distances are shown in the table below. The distance was measured from when the brake pedal was pressed (this is important for the trucks because air brakes).

For those who are not interested in mathematical and physical formulas, skip the rest until you get to the table.

I also thought that I'd put a simple formula for calculating the braking distance (assuming friction limited braking) here. For those who now, it is really simple physics:

distance = v^(2)/(2\*g\*µ), where

v is the speed (in this case 80 km/h, i.e. 22.2 m/s)g is the gravitational acceleration (\~9.8 m/s^(2))µ is the coefficient of friction (unitless)

Note that the only sort of vehicle-dependent parameter here is µ. There is no mass in this formula because it cancels out. Yes, more mass requires a proportionally higher stopping force, but more mass also means a higher force (gravity) pressing the wheels into the ground, increasing the stopping force proportionally to the mass. Basically

post,1kylja5,,"⚡ PSA: Can’t Adjust Your Tesla Wall Connector Settings Anymore? Here's How To Fix It (Gen 3, 2025 Method)","**TL;DR:**  
Tesla seems to have quietly killed the web setup process for Wall Connectors. If you're stuck with the “Download the Tesla One App” message at [192.168.92.1]( stop wasting time. Download the *Tesla One* app, select “External Partner,” enter your Wall Connector serial manually, and use Setup Mode (blinking green) to reconfigure your unit.

\--

Alright Reddit — if you’re trying to reconfigure your Gen 3 Tesla Wall Connector (like resetting it or changing the breaker size), and all you’re getting is the “Tesla One App – Partner Access Only” screen at [` here’s what actually worked for me after way too much trial and error. Tesla has changed how commissioning works, and most of the info online is now outdated.

# What You’ll Need:

* Tesla One App (not the regular Tesla app)
* Wall Connector serial number (usually on the back of the unit, behind the cover)
* A Tesla account (yes, even if you don’t own a Tesla)
* Your Wi-Fi password
* A little patience

# Steps to Reset or Recommission:

1. Download the **Tesla One App**
2. Choose **External Partner** when prompted
3. Log in or create a Tesla account
4. Tap: *Installs → Continue → Go to Home*
5. Tap **Begin Install**
6. Choose **Enter Connector Info Manually**
7. Type in your unit’s serial number
8. Put your Wall Connector into setup mode by holding the charging handle button for \~6 seconds until the LED blinks green
9. Tap **Join** when prompted
10. Follow the rest of the prompts:

* Set country
* Adjust breaker size (e.g., 50A sets output to 40A)
* Connect to Wi-Fi

# Quick Note:

I’m not an electrician — just a guy trying not to burn down the garage. My setup was wired to code for a 60A breaker, pulling 48A no problem. But during the county inspection, the inspector flagged it and made us swap to a 50A breaker due to some old local rule about cable length and attic heat. Tesla doesn’t make it easy to manually downrate the charger anymore unless you use this exact method.

post,1kyk96u,,Wall connector: NACS or Universal,"Hey there,
I have a 26 Juniper and 21 Bolt. Obviously, different connectors for charging with NACS and J1772. 

I moved recently and to have a new plug installed outside with my Grizzl-E’s NEMA 14-50 is not recommended without a GCFI breaker. I have decided to sell the Grizzl-E and purchase a Tesla wall connector. 

I regularly charge my Bolt at Superchargers with a A2Z EV CCS1 to NACS connector and also own a A2Z EV NACS to J1772 connector. 

Which way do you think I should go?

1. Tesla Wall Connector with NACS only and then use the A2Z adapter with the Bolt. 
2. Tesla Universal Wall Connector with NACS and J1772. 

Cost difference is $420 vs $650.

post,1kxsby5,,"Tesla targets June 12 launch for robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg News reports","(Reuters) -Tesla is poised to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin on June 12, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The date has been discussed internally and could still change, the report added.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Earlier this month, CEO Elon Musk said the EV maker is set to begin a test of its long-promised robotaxi service on schedule in Austin, Texas, by the end of June.

A successful robotaxi trial is crucial for Tesla as Musk has shifted the company's focus away from building a new, cheaper EV platform to launching the robotaxi service and its Optimus humanoid robots. Much of Tesla's valuation hangs on that bet.

Tesla sales have fallen worldwide with rising competition and as Musk faces a backlash for his political views and his role as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this is possible via the [vehicle commands API]( or through the Tesla App itself. My use case: I have a battery-powered (independent of the vehicle HV/LV batteries) Dashcam that charges via the onboard 12V when I'm driving the car. 



Unfortunately, during long absences between driving / very short drives, I'm not able to charge the battery enough to get a reliable 12 - 14 hours of standby recording. I could leave the setting on permanently but this is wasteful and results in significantly higher idle-power usage. 



Ideally, I'd like a setting where I could have 12V power for 1-2 hours (enough to charge the battery, and then shutoff). Rivian has a feature like this and I've found it super helpful. It would also be cool to enable this as an API command and then use Tessie to trigger automations.



Why do I use an external dashcam? The optical quality of Blackvue dashcams is superior to Tesla's cameras and this has allowed me to capture license plate details where Tesla's built-in cameras have failed. I also like the fact that the front lens features a 136 degree wide horizontal capture angle, which allows me to get more of the road.

post,1kx4kb9,,Model 3 HW4 FSD Software Crashes and AP Critical Alerts. Any experience or advice?,"I wanted to get some input from you guys related to an issue I've been having with my 2024 Model 3 to see if anyone else has experienced my issue and if so, what did Tesla do to resolve it:

  
Over the past several months, I've had an intermittent issue where I'll be using FSD and the car will start alarming and saying to take over immediately followed by ""Autopilot aborted due to system error"". It then takes 5 or so minutes for it to come back online. At first, I brushed it off as a bug in the software, but it became more frequent and recently went as far as braking to a stop and putting itself in park in the middle of a highway.

  
What's odd is that after it does its reboot, there are no lingering user facing errors or notifications to get the vehicle serviced. In service mode the main alert showing up is APS\_w159\_apbCritical which states ""*Autopilot Processor Secondary (APS) detects that the Autopilot Processor Backup (APB) is not functioning as expected, making Autopilot (AP) features unavailable.""* 

  
I've already made a service appointment, but the Tesla service technician seemed to be dismissive of there being a real problem and scheduled me pretty far out.

post,1kwx3a7,,Headrest Question,"Hi everyone,

I noticed yesterday that my passenger headrest in my 2021 Model Y. From my research, this appears to be a common issue.

I sent in a service request and received an invoice for $205. Looking on third-party sites, I can find OEM headrests for ~$50 and can easily replace it myself. However, this OEM number is 1623801-00-A. The OEM part for the headrest that Tesla quoted me was 1623798-91-C.

Again doing research, I cannot find much difference between these OEM parts. Both appear to fit my 2021 MY. It appears the Tesla quoted OEM would include abilities for “special features”? I am not sure what special features would be included in my headrest.

I plan on getting a model s 2022LR this coming fall from Tesla or a local dealership and then eventually a model x and I am by no means a speed performance guy or really care about the looks of the rims. That’s why Idgaf about the plaid trims

Trying to find some rims and wheels not breaking the bank/or atleast are reasonably priced but provide the best efficiency but also provide the rim protection or at least overlap to help prevent cracking the rim or road rash. Pros and cons to the sizing of wheels are appreciated too, but I’d imaging I’m pretty onset for 19” for the model s. 

(I’ll go to a model x refresh once it drops down to high 30’s/low 40’s hopefully) 
With this it’ll be my daily driver, but once we move this model s will go to my fiancée and she is sometimes a curb monster and I don’t want to have to worry about it. 

Anyone got any recommendations? 
Model s and x references are appreciated! 
Thank you! 
I don’t know much about tires and rims for EV’s or ICE to be honest, so I hope I’m not poking the beast.

It seems that regardless of whether I have the car in chill, standard, or hurry mode, it does this strange thing where it hesitates all the way until the very last second of an exit. 

For instance, let’s say the exit is in 500 feet, the Tesla puts on its blinker in the next lane over and waits until I’m 50 feet away to even change into the exit lane. This feels unnatural, unsafe, and I have no idea why it’s been doing it. Most of the time I have to take over. 

It’s even had some close calls at very risky curves and ramp entrances, making me nervous that it will suddenly jump sides at the last second and possibly hit the barrier.

Planning on going wider than stock for extra grip.

295/40 R19 rear | 295/35R19 for the PS4S

The Pz4 has a lot of hate online. But I found a closeout pricing for 4 tires for around $1050. Tbh the stock pz4s were honestly fine. Maybe a bit understeery on the limit and felt too twitchy at high speeds. 

The PS4S seems to be the gold standard (wanted the PSS5 but not available in my size) but it would cost around $1900 for a set of 4. 

That's a huge difference in pricing but the biggest problem is that the PZ4s have horrible tread life.

post,r7xlp8,,I just test drove the Ioniq5 and EV6,"This week I test drove the KIA EV6 and the Ioniq5 and I want to post some unfiltered thoughts about them (bonus content at the end).

&#x200B;

Preface: I live in southern Germany and my daily driver is a RAM 1500 LPG (exotic car around here) but I am on the fence of trading it in for a - non VAG - BEV. I had never driven an EV before and since I have a family I need a roomy car that also appeals to me visually and emotionally.

&#x200B;

First was the **EV6** LR RWD GT-line model and I love the estetics on the car, it is just gorgeous, even the rear end is! Having seen every YT review there is finally standing in front of it was exiting and it is bigger than you would expect from the videos and images I had seen before. Getting into the driver seat the seating position is good, no issues seeing all of the driver screen after adjusting the seat and wheel. The seats are some kind of two tone leather/alcantara look-a-like apparently made from plastic bottles, pretty cool, and are comfortable! Steering wheel is clean and has real buttons (looking at you ID.4!) and a drive mode selector (like in a Ferrari, nice!). I like the concept of the switch between climate and car functions so I can adjust the climate while turning a real rotaty dial. I just whish there was a real button to switch between the two modes.

&#x200B;

Before reversing out of the dealer's parking lot I check out the various camera settings the car had equipped. As someone who can park a 6m long RAM blindfolded I was a bit hesitant trusting the 360 camera since the rear window is tiny to say the least, but the car gives you various angles and you can also switch to a front or rear view only camera which has a very good resolution and is as sharp as the one in my wife's more expensive BMW.

Now under way the first thing I want to check out is the one pedal driving so I trigger one of the paddle switches and am unfortunaltely greeted with an error saying the regen can currently not be switched.

post,rjjjq4,,"what vehicles can substitute for a home battery (eg Powerwall), including for solar","What existing & upcoming EVs (especially non-pickups) can substitute for a home battery (like a Tesla Powerwall)? At least given the right interface equipment.

I know that given the right bidirectional charger, like a [Wallbox Quasar]( EVs using the (now less common) CHAdeMO standard are supposed to be able to power a home, but I think I read that only the Nissan Leaf works with this in the US so far.

I know that Ioniq5 & EV6 (& presumably GV60 when it arrives) have some V2L (vehicle to load) ability that can be used to power camping equipment or other normal devices, but I haven't seen much discussion of them powering a home. I've read headlines about Ford F150 pickup being able to power a home (with the right extra equipment), but I'm not in the market for a pickup.

Tesla Powerwalls are very hard to get these days due to chip shortage and/or general supply chain issues. I had 1 solar installer tell me their lead time for a new Powerwall install was 12 months. I'm curious if the Ioniq5 or EV6 will be able to substitute for a home battery the way the Leaf w/ Quasar purportedly can, or whether you can only hook up a limited number of normal appliances to it as if it's basically just an electrical outlet.

My understanding is that home solar requires a grid or battery. Grid-connected solar panels that don't have home batteries as part of the system cannot power a home even during bright sunlight hours if the grid goes down (due to a whole neighborhood blackout or due to the powerline to the house being cut for example). What EVs (other than F150) can allow solar panels to work during a blackout just like a Powerwall or equivalent home battery system would?",1639870508.0,2021-12-19 00:35:08,10,28,kpfleger,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/rjjjq4/what_vehicles_can_substitute_for_a_home_battery/,True,0.86,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,nmx12j,,Does anyone know technically how Vehicle2Home/Grid works in combination with solar?,"So I’ve been thinking about the F150 vehicle2home/grid backup power thing and I am trying to understand how it works/how it gets wired up.

In a traditional solar only install - if you lose grid power, your solar array stops generating, otherwise you would back feed onto the grid which is bad.

In solar with batteries like Powerwall, there is a power transfer switch that senses when grid power is down and disconnects the house from the grid, and then uses the solar to power the home and charge the Powerwall if there is excess generation OR if there is not enough generation, the Powerwall kicks in to augment the solar generation to power the home.

My question is - with vehicle2home/grid is the same going to be technically feasible? Maybe I don’t understand how it works, but when the power transfer switch is set to grid versus no grid, how does the solar still provide generation in both of those instances unless it is wired to both sides of the power transfer switch?",1622205844.0,2021-05-28 14:44:04,10,42,constantlyanalyzing,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/nmx12j/does_anyone_know_technically_how_vehicle2homegrid/,True,1.0,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

As a Tesla owner and TX resident, it was frustrating to not be able to utilize the battery in my car as my power went out. I recognize there isn't a huge market for this yet (or is there?), but as Lucid announced this feature as part of its lineup, it still seems like utility companies would need to be on board and all sorts of new hardware/infrastructure. I don't want to have to buy aa powerwall, but could be motivated if I could connect my car to it as an additional 'wall'

post,p35813,,Test drove an IONIQ 5 today (Germany),"I'm quite impressed by the car, I like it a lot. I've already tested a Model S and an Ampera-e (Chevy Bolt in the US). It's very responsive even in ECO mode, fast in the Autobahn: 192 km/h top speed out of the 185 stated, perhaps it's applying our standard 3% excess in the speedometer. Of course, nothing to be doing all the time and definitely not in long trips :-)

I usually drive a coupé (Opel Astra GTC) and I could say it compares well in dynamic behaviour, although it feels a bit awkward sitting so high up in comparison.

I even charged it for a while at home, since they gave it to us for a full day, so there was time. The 1-phase charger works just fine. I have solar panels on the roof and a 20A circuit in the garage, meaning the maximum setting for the charger (2.5kW) was OK with it. We also have an unused 3-phase circuit, which means installing a wallbox is definitely an option.

Perhaps the only defect I found while driving was the blinker/light control being too close to the paddle for the regen. I ended up accidentally flashing someone in the distance while trying to regen on some pile-up traffic, I hope he didn't notice that :-D

I'm however a bit confused by the leasing conditions. I got an offer with a 4.99% interest rate, which I thought was steep, since Tesla is offering 2.99% in Germany. Then I checked the Hyundai website and their leasing interest rates are all over the place. Some models have as low as 0.99% and others as high as 3.99%. Any insight would be appreciated. I have the feeling that this might be because it's a new model, and there's quite some demand, so they want to cash in on that.

In any case, I'm going to wait for the KIA EV6, which should land here in September. I like the outside styling a bit better, and I guess I might decide between the two depending on the lease conditions.

post,n9czz2,,Just finished my curbside public charger! [Six-month follow-up],"[Original Post](

So I've had my curbside charger installed for six months now and I thought it'd be a good time for a follow-up post.

First, here are some stats:

Total visits: 66

Total kWh given away: 514.40.

Total check-ins on PlugShare: 16

Most visitors in one day: 3

Operating cost: ~$9.50/month.

I was able to link the power meter up to an ESP8266 and connect it to [Pushover]( so every time someone begins to charge, I get a ping to my phone, and when they finish, I get another ping with how much they used. My security camera just barely covers the charger, so I used the footage to record make/model of the car. I didn't record license plates, and the videos are deleted after a week to respect the privacy of the visitors.

**General observations:**

When I installed this thing, I really didn't think anyone was going to use it. I don't live near any shops or stalls or anything, so what would people do while their car charged? Well with the exception of my neighbor who lives two houses down, every single visitor just stayed in their car the whole time.

This was a little awkward at times since the parking spot points right at my living-room window. If I did it again, I would have installed the charger in a different spot where we'd get some privacy from the shrubs. People were generally polite though. Some would even shut off their headlights while pulling up if they arrived after dark.

In the past thread, lots of people were concerned about folks ""abusing"" my free charger. The closest we got to that was someone in a new Bolt who I'm assuming didn't have their home charging solution figured out. They spent a total of 12 hours sitting in their car outside my house in the course of a week but only stopped by occasionally after that.  There's also my neighbor who charged every weekday for almost a month but then probably gave up when they realized that having to come back every day to un-plug/repark the car wasn't worth the $18/mo it was saving them.

post,l7cdt8,,Electric RV,"I'm guessing it doesn't exist today, but I want it...

I want a fully electric Class A RV. I want solar panels on the roof and on awnings on both sides. I want it to have at least a 5-600 kwh battery pack. I want it to have some flavor of auto pilot so driving isn't as draining on the driver.

Just think about that. How cool that would be. You drive until you get down to 10% battery. You park somewhere pretty and stay a few days or a week and your battery is full again and you get to peace out.

Say you can fit 50 square meters of panels on the roof & awnings, even if you only get 2-3 kwh per day per square meter, you can recharge to max in 5-6 days. Or you stop at a camp site or charger and are on your way again in just a few hours.

Maybe get one of those tiny evs to take with you in a little garage or towing behind.

----------------

I suppose the reason nobody's building my dream is because the market is tiny.

You could get a similar vibe by using a Cybertruck or Rivian or Hummer, and then just a normal 5th wheel. But even then... it's just not as good. Harder to charge, harder to use the power of the towing car in the camper or to charge the car with the camper's PV's... but you would have a car when you got there to drive around.

Maybe if they put like 150 kwh of battery in a camper itself, so you can use it as a mobile charger... that might work, and it would probably be a lot cheaper.",1611876432.0,2021-01-29 00:27:12,20,23,Valendr0s,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/l7cdt8/electric_rv/,True,0.9,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

There's even an outlet of some kind there, though I don't know the specs yet (probably whatever's used to power winter heaters, whatever they are?). I plan to talk to the community association to maybe install and pay for an EV charger, but have no idea how that will go. There are some public chargers around AFAIK,  so I should be able to get by?

Concern #1 is eco-friendliness, which is why we're looking at EVs, concern #2 is low maintenance, which is why PHEV are on the table, but I don't think are our option.

Honestly, we don't really want a car and would prefer to continue relying on public transport as we did back in Moscow. But since we moved into our neighborhood going anywhere (including groceries) has been a real pain, so we decided that a car is required after all. Still, ideally, the car would be ""buy and forget about it"", which from what I gathered is more or less is the experience with BEVs (and not with PHEVs because you would get all the complexity of ICE on top of EV benefits). While I understand the gist of how all the types of cars work, I would prefer to keep my knowledge of specific parts involved to a minimum.

post,qz3zsc,,"Test drive a Polestar today, and my thoughts.","Background: Currently own a 2021 Model 3 LR. Missed the luxury of my Lexus and the rear hatch so I decided to give Polestar a try since I could basically 1-1 trade my Tesla for the Polestar. I average around 24k miles/year.  

Dealership experience: Sucked. I guess Polestar is going the Tesla route but they haven’t fully nailed it yet. I test drove my Polestar 2 at Polestar South Coast (it’s just a Volvo dealership). I had an appointment, but I still had to wait 40 (!) minutes for my test drive.

Pros of Polestar:

-	loved the way it looked

-	Hatchback is wonderful

-	Pilot Assist was just as good as autopilot (didn’t get to test any edge cases)

-	Gauge cluster was fantastic. Very quick, responsive, and had good information. Love it, wish Tesla had one. 

-	Acceleration was plenty

-	Android Automotive was a good system, didn’t miss CarPlay or Android Auto. Very fast and responsive. Not a downgrade from the Tesla screen

-	Interior looks good *

-	I can get it sooner than a Tesla if I was ordering. 


Cons of Polestar:

- The interior looks good, but feels cheap. I felt like I was sitting in a Corolla. Tesla has better materials. This was the biggest drawback, I felt closer to my Lexus in my Tesla than I do in the Polestar. *
-	Seats were comfortable, but the materials on the seats was bottom quality. 
-	The interior was small and cramped, it was smaller than the model 3 both inside and outside. 
-	Only 1 cup holder unless you sacrifice the entirety of your center console for an additional one. 
-	Piano black center was already scratched up in the demo car. 
-	Uncomfortable driving position/nowhere to rest elbows
-	Google Automotive: I don’t really trust Google to keep their products up to date; the company is notorious for making and then killing products if they don’t take off. 
-	(Subjective) I think the Android Automotive UI isn’t that great, lots of wasted space and poor design.

I have charging at home so public charging infrastructure isn’t a huge deal to me. I’ve test driven both and I go back and forth daily on which one I want. It feels like the cars are evenly split. 

To my knowledge the Model 3 has: 

better range / better acceleration with option for OTA acceleration boost / supercharger network / standard autopilot / better tech to include mobile app / LR comes with all season tires / Is 700lbs lighter which helps with tire life 

The polestar 2 has:

better build quality / less rattles and road noise / better handling / is supposedly faster than listed 4.5 0-60 time / a gauge cluster / exotic looks / 2 free years of fast charging at EA / exclusivity/ has 0% apr on financing and is eligible for $7500 tax credit, although is more expensive than M3 when specced out

post,qped2w,,EV for my father (70+),"I drive a Model 3 LR AWD, and have been for almost 3 years. My father has always loved the car, but I got the usual arguments ""Not enough range"" ""Too expensive"" ""Where would I charge"" blah blah. He's got a 380V outlet in the garage, so he's almost good to go right now, just saying.

Last weekend, he said he'd looked at a BMW. 50k+ Euro car but an ICE. I asked him ""If you're spending that kind of money, why not an EV? By the time you want to sell your BMW used, nobody will want it anymore"" (say 2032-ish, if he drives it for 10 years).

So anyway, maybe I should have shut up there but I told him about the 5000 Euro credit he gets from the government (Germany), the 10 years of no road tax, and that his cost per km will probably get cut in less than half (his current car doesn't run below 12 liters of 100 octane per 100 km).

Long story short, I am now charged with finding different EVs and we will go and test drive them together. He's an old guy and his back is shot, so a Model 3 or a similar sedan is not going to be possible. Also he needs towing capacity for getting firewood and such. So my very short list now contains:

* Model Y LR AWD: 59k Euros, lower trim is not available (and who knows when it will be), tow hook has to be installed after delivery for extra cost. Set of winter tires runs an extra 3k. 75 kWh battery, 507 km range, 16.9 kWh/100 km combined. Altogether an easy 64k and that doesn't even include ""Autopilot"" (haha).
* VW ID4 LR RWD: 54k Euros, tow hook, a set of 19"" winter tires and lots of gadgets included. 77 kWh battery, 500 km range, 18 kWh/100 km combined
* Hyundai Ioniq 7: Not much is known, apart from that it's supposed to come out in 2023. But if it's anything like the Ioniq 5, it will be an awesome car for the price.

If I just compare Tesla and VW, the ID4 is the clear winner. It's too bad Tesla doesn't make LR RWD vehicles anymore, those were beasts as far as range was concerned, and good value for money.

post,qkup2g,,Nearly got rear ended by a Tesla autopilot glitch,"I rented a model s for a road trip in Vegas.  My partner and I were both super impressed by the car and loved driving it on windy roads with little traffic.

However, when I was using autopilot on the freeway going 70, the car suddenly started aggressively breaking nearly causing the person behind me to rear end me.

I think what happened is the autopilot thought the road has changed to 25/35 mph from 65 (which I've rarely if ever seen).

I'm curious:
1) how often does this happen?
2) why doesn't the autopilot start slowing down ahead of time instead of aggressively breaking?
3) why hasn't Tesla audited their data?  It seems pretty ridiculous to accept that much of a difference in speed change and would be an easy audit to run on their map data",1635821494.0,2021-11-02 03:51:34,9,18,Zealousideal-Ant9548,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/qkup2g/nearly_got_rear_ended_by_a_tesla_autopilot_glitch/,True,0.61,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,q9ds58,,Advice please... IONIQ 5 58kwh or Tesla Model 3 SR?,"I am very torn between the above cars... I am looking to buy an EV soon. It will be on a 4 year PCP deal 15k miles pa with around £7000-9000 deposit to put down.

I have been drawn to the software behind the Tesla cars over the past couple of years.  But when sitting in the Ioniq... I realised it really has a brilliant interior and a few new nice features, like the vehicle to load feature.

My main Tesla M3 pros:
 - The software and infotainment
 - Autopilot and sentry modes
 - Panoramic sunroof

IONIQ 5 pros:
 - Nicer Interior... bigger space & boot space
 - Vehicle to Load feature
 - Exterior design

With all things considered, and similar financing figures, the IONIQ 5 58kwh (~230 mile range) and Tesla Model 3 SR (~267 mile range) prices are coming out as the following:

IONIQ 5 - £438 pm £9000 down
Tesla M3 SR - £485 pm £9000 down

These cars would each be mainly for motorway driving (70-150mile trips). Range does not bother me too much as I would rarely do trips longer than this. 

One concern of mine with the IONIQ 5 is the lack of a rear wiper on a hatchback style rear end. I fear that rain and snow would cause visibility issues through UK winters, I've seen a few videos of this and no evidence of a similar problem with the Model 3. 

One concern with the Tesla is the less practical boot space.

Is the Tesla infotainment, software, range and panoramic sunroof worth the £30pm jump up? Opinions??

post,q8uy5o,,Is Tesla becoming complacent?,"Might get downvoted by the Tesla fanboys, but here we go:

I started looking into cars (specifically EVs) at the start of 2021, and at first the Model 3 seemed like a very innovative car loaded with cool features such as the big, non-laggy screen, autopilot, sentry mode, fast acceleration, supercharger network, frunk, etc...

However, as the months pass, I was less and less in love with the car, and I started to notice more and more shortcomings with the car, especially after taking a test drive. In a year where tons of new EVs are coming out, I feel like Tesla has stopped innovating but instead is making their cars less and less appealing. Here's a few examples from the top of my head:

1 - Rising prices (2k increase), and removing the cheaper trims from being sold altogether. Their interior is already very barebones compared to other cars (few physical buttons, no driver display) , and now even their cheapest trim is priced as a luxury car.

2 - Removing the lumbar support because ""people didn't use them"".

3 - No driver display, no blind spot detection on side mirrors, no heated steering wheels, no ventilated seats, the touch screen controls 90% of the car's configurations.

4 - FSD being nowhere close to what it is advertised.

5 - Elon saying that the Supercharger network will be open for everyone.

6 - They just changed the free premium connectivity from 1 year to 30 days

7 - No more free Supercharger referrals

8 - In Canada, only the SR+ is eligible for the 13k rebate, meaning that if I want AWD for the rough winter times, the net difference between SR+ and LR is almost 25k.

I know that Tesla is doing very well and their demand is crazy, but I simply feel like I am getting less and less of a deal as time passes, especially since so many new EVs are coming out from traditional automakers.",1634324124.0,2021-10-15 20:55:24,305,443,lncognito_Mode,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/q8uy5o/is_tesla_becoming_complacent/,True,0.73,2021,both,search,False,False,0,

post,q5wrfs,,Looking for suggestions to replace the model 3,"Hey there, 

I was looking to get some feedback from the community. I am looking into replacing my model 3 with another EV. I have a few gripes with the model 3 SR+ , and am hoping to find an EV that can address those. I wanted to see if former/current model 3 owners have any suggestions or thoughts: 

1. Seat position: for a tall person, the seating position is too low and uncomfortable for long trips.
2. The suspension is too stiff and loud
3. Range and degradation: as is customary with Tesla, overpromising and underdelivering. My range has dropped from 402 km to 360 km after 15 months (nominal capacity down from 52.4 to 47.8 according to OBD). Not to mention you have to charge to 100% for these numbers (which Tesla advises against on a regular basis), and then I only get around 330 km in ideal conditions not using AC (290 if charged to 90% which I usually do) 
4. Having a hatch would be nice for the dog

I have shortlisted the following:
- ID4 AWD seems to be the best bang for the buck, especially considering it's the only other EV qualifying for the rebate from the feds here in Canada
- Audi Q4 and Mache e (more expensive and not getting the rebate). 

The one thing that is critical for me after owning the Tesla is whatever adaptive cruise control/Lane centering assist the other manufacturers use, should be as reliable as Tesla's autopilot for Highway commute.  

I appreciate the feedback from those who have experience driving/owning these options, or any other suggestions (Ionic 5? etc).",1633961627.0,2021-10-11 16:13:47,4,52,wicasapa,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/q5wrfs/looking_for_suggestions_to_replace_the_model_3/,True,0.56,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,p2vlh7,,"Skoda Enyaq, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Tesla Model 3 LR back to back test drive","So I drove these three pretty much back to back in test drives.As a bit of a background - I have worked for the last 10 years in ICE calibration, so I've driven a very large amount of different cars. My daily driver right now is a 2012 Audi S8.

After the test drives I ordered the Ioniq 5, and in my opinion it is the only one of the three that is really revolutionary in it's design, rather than just evolutionary.

**The Skoda Enyaq**'s downsides:

* Feels cramped in the front compared to both the Model 3 and the Ioniq 5.
* There is a massive hard center console just where you'd want to lean your leg, and on the other side you have a massive door handle.
* The infotainment system is the most far forward. To look at it, you really need to take your eyes off the road.
* Brakes make a weird sound when just coming to a halt - not the classic high pitched screeching when you have a lip on your rotors, something lower in pitch. Seems to be a common theme on the MEB platform.
* The handling is the worst of the three, with noticeable body roll. It's more people carrier than something you'd throw around corners.
* The performance is the lowest as well.
* The visibility out of the cabin is worse than both the Ioniq 5 and the Model 3.

There are some strong points:

* The regen braking and the transitions of the throttle pedal are very well done and damped. It cushions all kinds of abrupt throttle movements very well, and in general the feel is very similar to an ICE. It is the most refined out of the three. The regen settings have a very good range of selection.
* If you don't want to feel like you are driving an EV this is probably the best car. If you'd put someone unknowing into the driver's seat they might not even immediately realize it's an EV, that's how similar the feel is. And this is a testament to the engineering behind it. It is not easy to achieve calibration wise.
* The fit and finish of the interior is outstanding, the tactile feel of the controls is great, just",1628756512.0,2021-08-12 10:21:52,182,226,projix,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/p2vlh7/skoda_enyaq_hyundai_ioniq_5_tesla_model_3_lr_back/,True,0.9,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,ockg3z,,Thoughts from testing the ID4 and Mach E (own a Tesla and eGolf),"Did some test drives today for fun, specifically to try out autopilot alternatives. My reference points are a 2019 Tesla Model 3 with FSD and a 2019 eGolf. If you own one of these cars feel free to correct me if I’m wrong anywhere, only did one hour test drives.

ID4

I was pretty disappointed. The car all around felt cheap. Acceleration was similar to my eGolf, not exciting. Touch screen was super laggy and annoying to use (has trouble just scrolling). 

Adaptive cruise control and lane keeping were meh. They work ok on the highway, but not close to Tesla autopilot, not really usable on non highway (doesn’t start from a stop automatically, swerved in the lane a lot, doesn’t beep when it is engaged or disengaged). 

It didn’t have one pedal driving which is really the way to go once you get used to an EV. 

It was also a pretty small trunk, other than it being a hatchback I would say similar size to model three.

Mustang Mach E 

Ah this car was fun to drive. More comfortable than the ID4, felt a bit luxurious like a Tesla, seemed a bit quieter than my model three although I’ve heard the new model Y is quieter with the new windows. Acceleration was good, felt just a tad weaker than my long range model three. User interface was designed much better and had no responsive issues. 

Co pilot 360 was better than the ID4 but not quite autopilot levels. On the highway it seems to work pretty well, off the highway though it wasn’t really usable. Similar to the ID4, I really didn’t like how there was no audio sound when it was engaged or disengaged, it seemed like you could just disengage and start drifting. The ability to lane change while in copilot is nice, better than standard autopilot (but not as good as FSD or in enhanced autopilot that can change lanes for you). Having the screen in front of the steering wheel was kind of annoying because your copilot set speed can be blocked by the steering wheel. Definitely a reason the center screen is better.

For reference, I am currently looking at the latest ""base"" model of each, the Tesla Model 3 2021 standard-plus (without FSD) and Chevy Bolt EV 2022 (note that the Chevy Bolt EV 2022 doesn't release until later this summer and has 1LT and 2LT trim levels, feel free to use the 2021 model instead if that is easier to compare):  

it seems like both the Tesla and Bolt have: regenerative braking, rear backup cameras, Automatic Emergency Braking, Forward Collision Alert, Front Pedestrian Braking, automatic high beams, and an infotainment unit for navigation and music (for a monthly subscription price). They also both have the ability to remotely start the car's climate control, locate your car's location, and view your car's status / instrument readings with a phone app. The both have approximately the same range (250 miles). Both support level 2 home charging installations for fast charging and allow the user to configure the car to charge during off-peak hours to save on electricity costs.

The 2LT Bolt has a birds-eye view reverse camera, whereas the Tesla and 1LT Bolt do not (Elon claims a ""vector-space bird’s eye view"" will be added to FSD eventually, but I don't plan to buy FSD any time soon considering it is both costly and still in beta). The Tesla has adaptive cruise control for free as part of ""autopilot"" (not FSD), it is an option on the 2LT Bolt, and it is not available on the 1LT.

post,n0txcc,,Update on driving an electric vehicle:,"Well, I’ve already put about 2,000 miles on the Nissan Leaf and I’m a fanboy. Highly recommend. Never going back to ICEs. 

It takes about 65% of a battery charge to drive the 108 miles to work (in the fast lane of 495). When I get to work I can plug into a free -ChargePoin+ station (includes free parking) provided by my employer as an incentive. It takes about 5 hours to get back up to a 100% charge for the trip home. At home I had a smart splitter installed on the 240 volt/30 Amp dryer circuit which obviated the need to install an electrical sub panel or get a building permit saving a lot of money. We routed a cable to a (green) box outside the garage so I can charge up at home overnight when the electrical rates are cheapest. 

At work a large percentage of the power comes from Canadian hydropower so I feel good about being able to reduce my carbon footprint. At home it was a different story until I learned that there is a Massachusetts law requiring the large power companies to provide the option of allowing the consumer to choose where their power comes from. We elected to go with a provider that uses 100% wind power! So essentially for every kilowatt hour we pull from Eversource’s grid, they are are required to purchase that same amount of wind energy to put into their grid. So now I can say my car runs on wind power!!

The driving experience itself is wonderful. Smooth and strong acceleration and a pretty robust autopilot mode using front facing radar, multiple cameras, and a very intuitive control system. On full automatic (you still have to keep you hands on the wheel or it buzzes) the car stays in its lane, keeps to a certain speed that you set or maintains a set distance behind the car in front of you. In stop and go traffic the car even brakes to a full stop and starts up again when traffic resumes moving. Oh, and there is an e-pedal mode that kind of turns the gas pedal into a joystick for your foot.",1619660103.0,2021-04-29 03:35:03,42,24,sperks60,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/n0txcc/update_on_driving_an_electric_vehicle/,True,0.97,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,mbv6vg,,Tesla Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach-E?,"Looking for some advice as a form Model 3 owner and current Toyota RAV4 Hybrid owner in US-WI (read as gets cold). I'd like to get back into an EV and especially the Tesla family. I will be test driving both the Model Y and Mach-E. I've been reading up on both the Model Y and Mach-E and wanted to share some of what I've seen for consideration:

1. Charging - Tesla seems to be the clear winner when it comes to their supercharger network. I've mapped out many of the places I will need to go and Tesla has SC there. Ford relying on other networks seem both lacking and spotty looking at PlugShare reviews. 
2. Range - The Alex on Autos video is concerning as it seems the Mach-E is more true to range than the Model Y. Range is so tough as I've had a Leaf and Model 3. Winter kills EVs so I'll be curious how the Mach-E handles range then. It seems like Ford is trying to give a more realistic range estimate while Tesla wants you to believe they can provide more range. I'm getting anxious just thinking about it.
3. UI/Software - Tesla seems like a winner here, I've seen complaints on slow and laggy UI with the Mach-E. I really liked the Tesla interface in the Model 3 along with the updates. 
4. Autopilot/FSD - This isn't that big of a deal for me, but I will say the phantom braking whether from shadows or speed change could caused me more stress rather than making driving less stressful. 
5. Features - I'm surprised that Tesla hasn't included the following that the Mach-E has on day one. Some of these fall into the safety category that I would think Tesla would care more about:
   1. Carplay / Android Auto - I'll be the first to say I find Carplay finicky in my Toyota. I'd like to have the option use one of these, but not a deal killer if it's not included. 
   2. Blind spot indicator on the side mirror like every other vehicle so you're not glancing away or hoping the chime kicks in.
   3. 360 view - Seeing this in the Mach-E really makes me hope Tesla puts something similar ",1616552424.0,2021-03-24 03:20:24,45,107,madsteve99,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/mbv6vg/tesla_model_y_or_ford_mustang_mache/,True,0.93,2021,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,lfbnv6,,Recycling an old i-MieV,"Hello group!

I’m in a position where I’ll inherit an old sailing boat with a not particularly good inboard Diesel engine. I’m also in a position where my old Mitsubishi i-MieV is getting old and tired.

Has anyone any idea how I could go about boning the Mitsubishi for battery and engine, and to reuse it in my sailingboat? Parting the car into pieces is easily done, but I’m more concerned about the complexity of modifications and hardware needed to make it work in the boat. 

My thought is to use it both for propulsion as well as ‘domestic’ 220v appliances. Charging of laptops, phones, fridge, freezer and onboard navigation, autopilot and AIS.



I also plan on installing solar panels for the boat.

post,kp8opl,,Polestar 2 Performance Test Drive Impressions and semi-comparison to the Tesla Model 3,"Edit: geez people 🤣. I only did this write up to give a laymen perspective on a car that most of the country can’t drive, never mind see in person. Just trying to show a different perspective from the paid ad bullshit ev blog videos. Apologies if you find my write up offensive or unhelpful. I love EVS and any saltiness you get from this review is bc I think the polestar is another high priced, low spec entrant. We need to demand better if we are going to get people to adopt evs. 

Disclaimer: I am a Tesla owner and investor, but also a pretty huge Tesla critic/skeptic. I find Elon to be  repulsive, but important to the EV and sustainability movement. I find the QC and service experience at Tesla to be abismal, offensive, and I predict their growth will slow if they can't work out the major flaws in these two areas. Hopefully someone in here finds my experience useful. Take my flowerly language with a grain of salt. 

Overall Impression: 10/10 would never buy this car. Slow, clunky, cramped, lazy, uninspiring, expensive as shit, and terrible EV specs. I was SO STOKED to check this car out, but I wouldn't start investing in Polestar based on my experience. If you care to hear specifics, read on. 

**Background**

I am a day 1 line waiter for the model 3. Sight unseen deposit at the Fremont factory. Had a 2018 LR RWD with EAP. It was a fucking disaster. Vin of 12xxx, and every horror story you've heard online is what we experienced. I foolishly thought Tesla got their shit together since then so we sold it and bought a 2020 Performance Model 3. It also has a lot of problems and I do NOT recommend buying a Tesla if you are sensitive to the issues you typically hear about. Tesla tech, efficiency, and promise is lightyears beyond any other EV out there, though....so there is hope?

I received an ad for a Polestar 2 test drive on Instagram so I signed up. Got an email confirmation and a text this morning from the salesperson.

TL;DR: Tried the ID4, Ioniq 5 2WD, and Model Y LR. Settled on the Model Y because it:

* offered the most usable space distribution & format of the three
* had the most range and efficiency of the three (and included a heat pump, which really should be standard in all EVs in that price class)
* felt the nicest to drive despite the bumpy suspension; the one-pedal driving was notably smoother (especially compared to the rather jerky Ioniq 5)
* had a much better software experience (compared to the almost unusable system in the ID4 & the rather cluttered UI of the Ioniq) albeit with some notable frustrations \[UPDATE: Tesla was on the final iteration of the v10 UI at the time of this writing - v11 as a first impression, based on what I have read and seen so far, might have left just as bad as an impression as the other two cars\],
* benefits from the supercharger network for which we don’t need membership cards or any such nonsense; we can simply plug and go.

We are in the market for an EV. We will use the car that we buy so long as it can be used, and we have a specific set of priorities. We test drove three cars over the past month. I’m posting my impressions not just in the hope that it might help someone else out (like reading so many of your posts has helped me out), but also to consolidate my thoughts and perhaps even get some additional perspectives/opinions/insights. I may edit this to add / clarify things as I go along. This is an extremely long, potentially rambly post; you have been warned.

post,pgfbc4,,Teslabjorn tested the Model Y consumption,"[YouTube Video Link](

I had some discussion in the Ioniq 5/Skoda Enyaq/Model 3 topic. So now we have some numbers.

|Car|Cons. 90km/h|Cons. 120 km/h|Range 90km/h|Range 120 km/h|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla Model Y|148 Wh/km|206 Wh/km|473 km|340 km|

|Audi Q4 E-tron|154 Wh/km|225 Wh/km|487 km|332 km|

Unfortunately for the Model Y it is 10000 EUR more expensive (pre-subsidy price, more if you get FSD) than the Ioniq 5 or the Enyaq in maxed trim (which you should really be comparing anyway, as the kit you get on the Tesla is comparable).

Another perhaps noteworthy point is that out of these three the Ioniq 5 charges almost twice as fast 10-80%.

post,1hnmey6,,Counting EVs on the highway for fun (it's not),"Don't read this (or too much **into** this) unless you are as bored as I was. Every conclusion here is a small sample of observable stuff during a trip, so take it with a pinch of road salt.

**TLDR** : The Equinox EV is selling more than I thought, and Nissan EVs apparently can't go on the highway (joke, of course). Read more for my hot takes that will undoubtedly change your life.

I spent too much time doing this for its actual relevance. I'm off work and I do what I please with my own time, thank you very much

The other day I was a passenger on a pretty slow day on the highway with a couple of hours to go. Decided to count every visually-obvious BEV either oncoming or passing us (we were going 100 kph in our Bolt EV, so we didn't really pass anyone ourselves except some vans and the occasional slow semi). Driving on the A20 transcanadian highway in Québec, in cold temp (about -10 Celsius, so I expected to see less of short-ranged EVs). I thought I'd see something interesting during our 2 hours trip, and that it would be a fun (ok, not *very* fun, but I wasn't driving), objective way of figuring out popular brands and models... with some caveats :

* I probably did not recognize or spot every model, especially models that have ICE counterpart (ie : Soul and Kona)
* At some point we were in a traffic jam and some occurences might have been either missed or misindentified because of cars partially hidden.
* I did not include PHEV even if some are easy to recognize (ie : the Prius), because that would be unfair to other PHEVs that are very similar to ICE models
* I get distracted, sometimes. Let's assume it affected every model equally and move on.

Here's the list of EVs I spotted, by brand in alphabetical order (If I forgot a brand or model, it's because I didn't see it anyway) :

**BMW** : 2 total

* 2 unknown SUVs (I don't know their models but they were definitely EVs)

**Cadillac** : z e r o

* None

**Chevrolet (and Hummer)** : 40 total (#1)

So far the process hasn't been great honestly but I'm hoping that will change now that they have both the battery and the car in-hand.   

The TL;DR is that I completely understand that delays happen, especially around the holidays - but I think it's pretty lame that I've gotta chase them down to get any sort of info.  

  
Back in November I had some free time so I decided to swing by the shop and pop in to check the place out and hopefully schedule our upgrade.

OK, my mistake.    
  
So I placed the order for our battery through the person I was talking to at the time and was told they were a little backed up so it might be a week or two before they call us to schedule.  Understandable, no worries.      That day was Nov 11.  

Didn't hear anything from them, gave it some extra time for the Thanksgiving holiday and Dec 2 I called the main number to get a status update.

post,1hgkgpz,,Added a 2nd EV This Weekend!,"For the past few months, my husband (43M) & I (39F) have done a ton of EV research with the plan to buy or lease a second one in late spring. After the US election results, we decided to move that timeline up to…now. Financially, that actually wound up being a better decision because of end of year deals & incentives.

I currently drive a 2022 MINI Cooper SE. Her name is Winnie Cooper. She gets about 110 miles of range per charge. Our other car is, legally my grandmother-in-law’s, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with quite a few miles on it. Cosmetically, it’s in GREAT shape. His grandparents took really good care of it. Mechanically, something needs fixed about every other month now & we decided it was time to get something new.

Neither of us have a commute & we live in the city, so Winnie’s been perfectly adequate for around town driving. We need a larger vehicle for several reasons - my husband’s family lives about 60 miles away & Winnie is not able to do the drive on a single charge. They’re in a more rural area and there is literally one charger near there. It’s a Level 2 and it’s at a casino. The charging is free but the gambling is not! We also have 2 giant dogs & neither fit in Winnie. So even just going to the vet, we need something to haul them in. Add in the occasional CostCo run and it’s just easier to have a larger car for those trips.

I set some parameters - budget (less than $1000/month including insurance), size (has to fit in the garage but also has to fit dogs), BEV (no plug-in hybrid, regular hybrid, ICE, etc), & range (over 200 miles). We compiled a list of contenders & on Saturday set out about 10a to go drive a whole bunch of cars. The convenient thing about our metro area - there’s a street that has basically every car dealer you can think of in a 3 mile stretch (except Ford, for whatever reason). I chose not to test drive anything. This is technically my husband’s car, so I wanted to let him decide without too much of my influence.

[Charging at Skelton Lake Services, Leeds](

It’s raining, freezing temperatures, and it’s windy. It’s the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I’m a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my “Octopus Electroverse” card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

post,1hfgx4b,,Does TOU make sense in my case?,"So I recently (on Tuesday) got my Tesla Wall Connector installed. I’m loving finally being able to charge my Model Y at home now. 

I know you can save a lot by charging at home, and you can save even more with TOU rates. However, I’m not sure if it makes sense for me to enable TOU rates. 

We are a household of 2 people (me and my fiancee) and 2 cars (1 EV, 1 ICE). 

One reason I don’t think it’s be good is we work separate shifts. My fiancee begins her work days M-F around 4:00am to get ready for work, and leaves the house around 5:00am ish. She returns home around 6:30pm. She often spends her nights doing laundry, and watching TV. She usually goes to sleep around 9:00 and sometimes I come home to find her asleep on the couch with the tv still on. 

My work days, typically M-Th, begin around 11:30am, and I leave around 1:00pm and I get home around 12:30am. I’ll usually stay up for 1-2 ½ hours after I get home relaxing before I go to bed, I’m usually on my phone so not directly using electricity. On Friday’s I’m usually home, however I do work the occasional overtime shift consisting of anywhere from 6-8 hours of work. If I don’t work on Friday, I usually spend my day off watching tv or playing video games (on Xbox) if that matters. 

On the weekends we are both home usually and spend the weekend watching tv shows, playing video games and doing laundry. 

Our big electrical usage comes from A/C (which we don’t really use during the summer, only if it gets really humid out), our washing machine and dryer, and now the EV charger. We live in an older home, and sometime run an electric space heater in our bedroom before we fall asleep during the winter, usually for 30-60 minutes. We live in southern Wisconsin and our electric (and natural gas) provider is WE Energies. Our most recent bill had us using 879 KWH priced at 0.17154/kwh, for a total of $150.78. While doing research on TOU I found WE Energies terms [here](

post,1heu8rp,,The EV-9 solves our 3 adult seating problem,"TLDR I’m no longer squished between my children in the back seat when my husband, my mom, my two kids and I go out somewhere.

We had a difficult time finding an electric car that could solve for our 3 adults plus 2 kids (1 car seat, 1 low booster). Whether we took our gas CX5 or Genesis GV60 I would end up sitting between the kids. At one point we bought my sister’s Volvo XC40 and had to sell it a week later because it had a hump in the middle of the back seat floor and was the worst by far.

Before I say anything else: between my sister’s and my family, we’ve owned a Tesla Model X, some sort of Tesla sedan, a Rivian R1S, the Volvo (all them) and the GV60 and EV9 (us). THERE IS NO PERFECT EV for big families/3 adults. Some of the issues I’ve seen/experienced (none new but bear repeating):

1) Model X: Putting aside any personal feelings about Musk, the 3rd row is super uncomfortable. I had to sit back there once and aside from feeling like I was in danger of being crushed the entire time, my 5’2” body was very uncomfortable. That said, after taking the GV60 on a terrifying road trip through SE Texas, I’d be nervous to take a non-Tesla on a road trip through this state again.

2) My sister loves her Rivian. My husband and I don’t love how “tanky” it feels to drive, but also we didn’t experiment with any of the settings. Regardless, the third row there is also exceedingly uncomfortable for a grown person (and again, I’m only 5’2”.) Due to car seat/booster needs/safety/daily use, an occasional adult passenger would likely go back there. the Also duh, it’s really pricey

3) The GV60 isn’t a three row, but it was what we used for over a year. I love that car. I love its features, the way it drives. People online say it’s ugly, but I’ve gotten so many compliments on it, take that internet. What I don’t love is range anxiety on road trips, or having to take it in for recalls what feels like every three months (although at least they treat you like royalty when you’re ther",1734274699.0,2024-12-15 15:58:19,126,110,Praha3,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1heu8rp/the_ev9_solves_our_3_adult_seating_problem/,True,0.87,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1hcxguo,,"Model 3 Performance @ Streets of Willow: Touge Win, Lap Times, and EV Track Insights","I recently brought my Tesla Model 3 Performance out to a track event at Streets of Willow, organized by Corner-Exit.com. The schedule included a touge-style challenge and a traditional open lapping session afterward. The experience gave me a clearer understanding of how the Model 3 holds up when pushed in a competitive setting alongside traditional sports cars.

**Key Points:**

* **Touge Challenge:**
   * Cars involved: Tesla Model 3 Performance (my car), a Miata, and a 350z.
   * Advantage in EV: The standing start benefited the Tesla’s instant torque, consistently delivering 3.1s 0-60 launches simply by pressing the pedal.
   * Outcome: I took the top time of the day for the entire field of 50+ cars and managed to edge out the other cars Mod class, partly due to this strong start, although the Nexen N’Fera Sport R tires took some time to come into their proper operating range.
* **Open Lapping Sessions:**
   * Times: The Miata posted a 1:21.8, the 350z ran consistent 1:22s, and I recorded a best of 1:23.
   * Takeaway: While the Tesla excels at straight-line acceleration, its overall lap pace was slightly behind the top competitors, showing where EV performance stands against well-sorted ICE setups on a tighter track.
* **Side-by-Side Comparisons:**
   * To better understand performance differences, the 350z driver and I ran laps close together to compare corner exit speeds, braking points, and power delivery. It provided useful insights into where the Tesla’s torque advantage helped and where it couldn’t match a traditional RWD platform’s handling balance.

I’ve compiled footage from the event, including on-track video, telemetry overlay, and commentary, to help illustrate how the Tesla performed, what challenges I encountered, and what improvements could be made. If you’re interested in seeing an EV’s capabilities in a mixed field of more conventional sports cars, feel free to check out the video linked below.

post,1h85c3r,,Thoughts about EV's after 1+ year of ownership,"I bought a 2023 VW ID4 Pro S in October 2023, and recently took it on a road trip between the Bay Area and Portland, OR. I was going to write a post about that experience, but thought it would be more helpful to share other thoughts about EV ownership as well. This post is intended to help people who are considering buying (or just got) an EV for the first time.

 

**1. There are 3 types of chargers:**

* Level 1 plugs into a standard home outlet, and adds \~4 miles per hour of charging
* Level 2 is the ‘fast’ home charger – needs to be professionally installed because it uses a high voltage outlet. Costs vary but anticipate $1-2k for the charger + installation
* Level 3 chargers are available at charging stations only. These are much faster, and mostly used for road trips. They can charge most EVs to 80% in <30 minutes. Tesla’s supercharger network is by far the dominant charging network in the US. Other non-telsa networks include Electrify America, EV Go, and Chargepoint.

**2. Most people need to have an option to charge at home, but you don't necessarily need a professionally installed charger.**  A level 1 charger that plugs into a normal home outlet can add \~40-50 miles overnight if you plug it in when you get home and unplug when you leave the next morning. Even if your commute is longer than that, if you can plug in longer on the weekends, you can likely get by without any need for public charging. If you have a commute longer than 40 miles a day, and you can’t charge longer on the weekends, maybe you will have to charge every 2-3 weeks at the public charger. *A level 2 charger is awesome to have if you have the money and ability (i.e. not renting), but not necessary for owning an EV.*

**3. If you cannot charge the car at home in any way**, and you are relying only on public charging stations, you need to figure out how often you will need to charge the car. Anything more than charging every 2 weeks will be a headache in my opinion.

For $26K in my area you can get a certified pre owned (CPO) \*2023\* Tesla Model 3 in nice colors like Metalic Blue with under 20k miles on it. That's nuts. Sure it's a standard range but 272 miles is very competitive. I don't see why the 2023 Ioniq 6's is $35K CPOed. **The Tesla Model 3 RWD SR Gets No Respect.**

Now the one other car that gets even less respect is the Nissan Ariya. It's nuts that 2023 models are going at 50% of MSRP and often they are lease returns (Nissan apparently had an 18 months lease) so they've got around 10k miles on them. The interior of even the basic Ariya's are plush and the top of the line Platinum+ is Napa leather, sueude, HUD, Bose audio, active noise cancelling, ventillated seats the whole shebang, classy interior etc. What the MB EQB 250/300 should have been and is not. The main fault (and it's a big one) is that it home charges very slow (must 7.2 kw) so with the big 87kw/h battery it takes 12+ hours to charge up. The fast-charging on paper is slow (maximum of 130 kw) but it holds that well into the 50%s SOC here in CA. You can get a top of the line Platinum+ with all of the above AND AWD (383hp) for $28K and $30K CPO'd. In comparison the EV6 GT-Line (35k+). In comparison the Mache E Premium 2022 model is often available for just over $30K in my area but they get sold quickly and in comparison to the Ariya Platinum Plus: I) No HUD, No Napa, No Bose, No ventilated seats etc. so all the creature comforts are lacking.

post,1h1rcge,,India’s EV Revolution: Key Launches and Strategic Opportunities for Gogoro,"India’s EV market is poised for rapid growth, driven by sustainability goals and government support. Experts predict that India could become one of the world’s largest EV markets by 2030, fostering a greener, more energy-efficient future. This week, Honda and Ola Electric introduced new products to the Indian market.

**Honda’s Launches:**

***Honda Activa e:*** Powered by two swappable Honda Mobile Power Pack e: batteries. Honda currently operates 84 swapping stations in Bengaluru, aiming to expand to 500 across three cities by 2026.  
***Honda QC1:*** Features a 1.5 kWh fixed battery, rechargeable at home with a dedicated charger.

Honda’s strategy—offering both swappable and fixed-battery scooters—highlights its focus on battery flexibility. This dual approach could popularize battery swapping in India. Gogoro might adopt a similar strategy by either launching distinct models or integrating both charging methods. To scale efficiently in India, Gogoro could partner with local OEMs while concentrating on its core strength: battery-swapping networks.

**Ola Electric’s Innovation:**

Ola Electric launched a new scooter powered by versatile **PowerPod** priced at ₹9,999. With a 1.5 kWh capacity, it doubles as a portable battery and inverter, capable of powering small household appliances like lights, fans, TVs, and Wi-Fi routers. This solution is particularly valuable for semi-urban and rural areas with limited electricity access.

Gogoro, which currently emphasizes battery-swapping subscriptions, might consider launching a similar home charger. It could power household devices and serve as a UPS, leveraging old batteries for second-life use cases. This approach could attract new customer segments, such as homeowners with solar panels who could store energy in Gogoro batteries.

**Market Potential:**

India’s early-stage EV market holds massive potential. If Gogoro secures a leadership position, it could oversee a vast network of battery-swapping stations and manage m",1732781848.0,2024-11-28 09:17:28,9,3,ChillerID,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1h1rcge/indias_ev_revolution_key_launches_and_strategic/,True,0.8,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1gyznda,,Tesla Model Y Fatality Rates Exaggerated in ISeeCars Study,"TL;DR: The fatality rate in the study is overstated by almost 4x and the Model Y scores unremarkably in reality. This suggests the whole thing is bunk in the absence of clearer details surrounding methodology and data quality. 

Lars Moravy, VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla, has posted [the true Vehicle Miles Traveled for the Model Y]( on X to be > 7 billion which is used to calculate the fatality rate. 

I have downloaded the official FARS data from the [NHTSA]( for 2020-2022 and filtered the *vehicle.csv* file in each one for the Model Y and occupant deaths. The Model Y was released in 2020 which is why these dates are used. 

This is done by filtering the VPICMODELNAME for “Model Y” and DEATHS > 0 for occupant deaths. This is documented on page 164 of the [FARS data manual]( 

This yields the following occupant fatal crash counts:

- 2020: 0
- 2021: 7
- 2022: 13

So for 20 deaths between 7-8B VMT yields a true fatality rate between 2.5-2.86 per billion miles traveled. 

**This is significantly lower than the 10.6 reported in the study and is in-line with the overall average they reported at 2.8**. This suggests that the data they are using may have quality issues and we should likely reject the entire study without clearer details on methodology which are vague and obscure. 

[ISeeCars source link](

If anyone is interested in [5 of the 7 fatal occupant crash summaries]( I wrote for the Model Y in 2021. Drunk/buzzed driving and seatbelts seem to be a key contributor. Also all were head-on collisions.

post,1gyr5oe,,Model 3 Owner - Drives in a Volvo EX30 and Kia EV3,"I have owned a Model 3 Dual Motor for the last 3 years, it goes back in a couple weeks so am looking at replacements.

Looking at a small SUV, narrowed it down to two options: Volvo EX30 and Kia EV3.

Drove both this weekend, test drives back to back, about an hour in each, as these are relatively new to the market I thought I’d share my impressions. Roads were soaking wet for both drives.

 

**Volvo EX30**

I drove the Single Motor Extended Range in Plus trim. 272hp RWD.

Slower than the Tesla but plenty quick. I was surprised how much traction it had even in RWD guise. The Twin Motor must be very fast.

Corners better than I expected. Feels a bit more crossover than the Tesla, obviously, but low CoG seems to help. Cornering and the drive out of corners was actually not bad. Not a sports car but didn't feel like trying to hustle along a boat.

It is a small car. Very little rear leg room. Front is plenty spacious. It felt no bigger than a VW Golf.

The ride…. is not great. Had that cheap car feeling of being bouncy and picking up every little bit of the road. It was felt unsettled on bumpier sections of motorway.

Hi-fi surprisingly good, if I take Tesla as 10/10, I’d say it was an 8.

Infotainment is google based. Snappy and worked well enough. I didn’t feel the need to connect Carplay. Some weird stuff though, no button on the steering wheel to play/pause music?!

It does lack some features that I really like about the Tesla: No dog mode, no phone key (yet), and the infotainment isn’t as good. No blind spot camera or auto indicators. Steering wheel and stalk setup not as good as Tesla. Only the very top trim has Drivers' seat lumbar.

Overall I would say 7/10. It drove better than I thought. It’s a close re-work of a Tesla interior but not quite as good. It feels very ‘built to a price’.

 

**Kia EV3**

They only come with 201bhp FWD powertrain. I drove GT-Line so 2^(nd) to top trim.

post,1gukbnc,,"Test drove a few EVs, and here are my very brief takeaways","My model Y lease is ending and I won’t be getting another one. Over the past few days I test drove the following in hopes of finding a replacement:

1. Bmw IX x drive50 - felt plenty powerful even with the base motor. Rear seat had good room. However the front seat wasn’t that comfortable given the price point, and the interior felt impressive at first, until I stepped inside the Mercedes. The ride quality, handling, sound insulation and sound system were sublime. The cargo space was surprisingly small for such a large vehicle. 

2. Mercedes EQE SUV 350 - felt downright slow compared to the IX, but more than adequate for most daily drives. Like the IX, the trunk looked smaller than the compact model Y. The exterior styling resembled a blob with a Mercedes logo. But the interior was truly a showstopper even without the hyper screen. The seats felt the most comfortable and thickly padded out of the cars I tested. 

3. Tesla Model X - terrifyingly quick, and has the familiar tesla UI. It’s also the most useful for my particular needs, which is occasional use of the third row, supercharger access for longer trips, and larger cargo area relative to the Mercedes and bmw. Honestly, the interior isn’t as bad as people say, sure it doesn’t have the ambient lighting and design details of the Germans, but it’s still a tangible upgrade over the model Y. But I didn’t care for the haptic turn signals on the steering wheel and shifting through the touchscreen as well. Ride quality is good even with the 22 inch wheels.

4. Rivian R1S dual motor - this one was the biggest surprise. Despite the positive reviews I read online, the R1S was clearly my least favorite out of this group. It had the worst ride quality regardless of which suspension setting I used, even thought I tempered my expectations since this is an off road capable vehicle.

A friend has a '16 Model S (first owner and he has the lifetime free SCN charging that can be passed on to another Tesla vehicle) and he will be driving it into the ground because Tesla is offering him $15,000 trade-in value.

Would appreciate the model year, make and model of the vehicle, what has been fixed/repaired on the battery pack and odometer readings.  With 324K members, I'm sure some can share their wonderful experiences and convince people on the fence that batteries can easily last 16 if not 20 years.

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.

This is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness.

post,1gj4del,,Tesla Model Y vs. Chevy Equinox EV (the family car buyer’s perspective),"After much deliberation about which would be better for my small family I think we have a winner, the Chevy Equinox EV. Let me explain.

So to be exact a 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT FWD vs a 2020 Tesla Model Y LR. The two cars I was choosing from were on the shortlist because they are the exact same price $31,000. The Chevy is new and the Tesla is used with 38,000 miles on it. 

For reference I have owned EVs for 8 years and my first EV was a 2016 Chevy Bolt. I loved that car. The only real problem was the charge speed was nowhere near where I needed it to be for long distance trips, which my family does often. I have also owned a 2021 Tesla Model 3 LR for 3 years and that car really spoiled me with its handling, acceleration, and the supercharging network is really special but it is to small for our family car. I never thought I’d buy anything other than a Tesla again but opening up the supercharging network up to non-Teslas has really got me thinking.

I test drove both of these cars and it’s pretty night and day as far as performance goes. The Model Y even has the acceleration boost upgrade. Not to say the Equinox EV wasn’t a smooth ride but it feels slow and heavy compared to a Model Y. The Model Y also felt like it had a bit more space in the trunk and more headroom. It’s a bit easier to take a car seat out also. So you’re probably thinking “what gives? Why did you decide on an Equinox EV?” A few big reasons. The first is that the Equinox was more comfortable. The seats felt better, the suspension was softer, and the infotainment was better in my opinion (something I thought I’d never say about a non-tesla) 

All in all we decided on a new car with full warranty and no wear. It was really close though and honestly in the near future I would love a Model Y or 3 as a commuter car.",1730688309.0,2024-11-04 03:45:09,99,129,jmbev,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1gj4del/tesla_model_y_vs_chevy_equinox_ev_the_family_car/,True,0.81,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1gc0uu3,,"Went to CarMax to buy an ICE for our second car, drove off in a Tesla M3. All ICEs seemed from a different era. What am I missing?","My wife and I own a Model S for years, and recently we decided to buy a second car (used). We were thinking ICE because (a) it's a bit cheaper, (b) we can use it for longer trips without the charging stops, (c) later if our oldest goes to a college without EV charging support, he can take the ICE car with him.

We test drove a few, all nice ICEs (budget: $20K-$30K). CarMax also had a 2021 Tesla M3 for just shy of $30K that we thought to also try. As soon as we set out to drive, it became obvious to my wife, my kid, and myself that the technology in the Tesla was overwhelmingly superior to all ICEs we tried. It was as through some sci-fi thing a car from the future was sneaked onto the lot that we could try.

Yet there's a lot of anti-Tesla and anti-EV sentiment going around. Including of course many reddit forums. Even the young CarMax salesman took the opportunity to recommend a Mazda over the Tesla because ""first off I don't like electric cars, I wouldn't drive one... then, Japanese cars are very reliable and get you good mileage"". I told him I appreciate the thought but we'll get the Tesla nevertheless. As he was going through the steps of showing me what CarMax extended warranty (which had zero customization for EVs) can offer me, I pointed out that an EV doesn't even have most of the covered parts and subsystems. The irony was lost on him.

post,1g9zilb,,Value Prop of Used ‘24 Genesis Electrified G80,"I wanted a highway commuter. 60-70 mi round trip. Would be third vehicle. I wanted an understated luxury, comfortable, EV sedan that would eat up highway miles. Only looked at sedans as wife and I both have SUVs. Cross shopped tesla model 3 highland, polestar 2, BMW i4/i5. Also consider used model S or lucid lease. No polestar or lucid space close to me was a con for those. I also have a good Genesis dealership which made the decision easier. 

While doing research on EV sedans prior to purchase, I felt like there was not a lot of info about the electrified G80. I haven’t seen many on the roads, but the ICE G80 has become quite popular and the C&D reviews are so positive for both. IMO this car is not worth its list price new. However, there are < 1 year old vehicles with $20-30k discounts, which is how I wound up in one. I wound up purchasing my 2024 Genesis eG80 used after about 8 months of corporate use for around $52k OTD. And I think for that price, this car is an absolute STEAL. 

Battery: 
- 87.2 kWh battery with 800V architecture
- 3.4-3.6 mi/kWh doing 70 mi round trip highway commute, 70-75mph
- Range is good, not great. ~260 miles at 80%. 
- Level 2 charging at home is necessary (not specific to this car of course)
- Genesis coming out with NACS adapter in a few months. 

Exterior:
- Quiet luxury. Not many people know the brand and doesn’t standout like the Germans.
- Cargo space not great. This is a highway utility barge for me, so I don’t care about cargo. But it generally is insufficient for its size if using for family. The trunk got eaten away by the battery. No frunk. But can still handle big Costco runs without issue. 
- Between wheelbase and clearance, I get in and out of my steep driveway (~17 degrees measured with iPhone) without scraping. 

Interior: 
- I’m 5’10” and have plenty of headroom. Everyone bitching about the floor being raised for the battery? Go sit in one and see how it fits your body type. But this is a non-issue unless your 6’2”+.

post,1g8jv19,,EV Rental in Spain  1X1 BMW,"Rented a mid-level BMW 1X1 in Barcelona Spain for two days for drive to small town 150km away.

The cars range is about 250 miles at 100% derating the WLPT rating to EPA.  Still hot in Spain so AC all the way.

The IX1 is a great car.  It had heads up display.  Its great when integrated with NAV and cruise control and has  become a must have feature.  Quiet, comfortable.   Regular car acceleration but that will help with range.

Charging in Spain turned out to be excellent.  Every large gas station had a couple chargers.    Typically just 50kW.  Might take extra time but that's about it.   Availability is all important. Even at 6AM I was able to get one to work from scratch, using the QR to get the app and using that for topping off for the trip after using the car the previous day.   That was the only time I needed on the road fast charging.  The town had two free L2 charges and plugged into one for the day. The Tesla S on the other charger was there when I got there and there when I left five hours later.

Parking garage in center of Barcelona had 20 chargers.  8 were just for Sixt, the car rental company, the others for the public.  When we were in the garage, always some public chargers available.  Parking garage for the car two blocks from our apartment had 2 x L2 which we used two nights.  That was super convenient having 100% charge.

Tesla chargers were available but we never got to try them out.  I have a Model 3 so ""Add your EV"" in the Tesla app was easy and it hten provide directions, maps, availability to use them.

The BMW nav app had a ""Go to charger feature"" which was good. It also had a nice feature of ""Start Preconditioning"" so could turn that on so you could charge faster.

Overall, renting an EV in Spain was easy with enough chargers to quell any range anxiety.",1729494780.0,2024-10-21 09:13:00,7,3,EaglesPDX,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1g8jv19/ev_rental_in_spain_1x1_bmw/,True,0.89,2024,both,search,False,False,0,

post,1fts32c,,Jumper Cables and Low Voltage Batteries?,"We recently became a 100% EV family (‘23 Model Y and ‘20 Bolt, woohoo) and as I was cleaning out my last gas car during trade in I picked up the jumper cables and thought “Does carrying these around really make sense anymore?”. 

I know most EVs have low voltage systems that are at 12V (for now) to run accessories, but I imagine the power rating on the low voltage battery is MUCH lower than for a gas car because there’s no engine to crank. So I’m guessing I probably wouldn’t be able to jump someone else’s gas car with my Tesla, and if the low voltage battery on my EVs started to go I might get an alert to replace it well before the car isn’t able to start/drive.

Any thoughts on this? Has anyone had a 12V battery on their EV die and leave them with an inoperative car? Has anyone jumped a gas car with their EV?

post,1fsy2gt,,Just bought a Onvo L60 today!,"Nio’s younger sibling in the house!

I woke up today and decided it was time to go out and finally buy my first car in China. I was thoroughly impressed by the L60. Benchmarked against the acclaimed model Y it is more spacious, luxurious, cheaper and more convenient. The styling is personal but I think it looks just as great, if not better. Compared to Xpeng G6, BYD Song, Denza, Nio ES/EC etc.. it seems to provide the greatest balance of design, luxury, convenience and cost.

Space: the clean interior borrows a lot from the model 3 which still has the appeal for those looking for a minimalist feel while adding some features of luxury. By far the MASSIVE 2nd row legroom and lay flat front seats are the real seller though. The car is only 8cm longer than the model Y and yet the amount of legroom achieved seems to appear way longer. Curious if anyone has a cabin cross-section comparison.

  
Luxury: the L60 comes pretty much fully loaded. Front cooled and air bag massaged seats, Heated four seats, as many cameras and 360 you'd like, pretty advanced ADAS/AD features. The fit and finish seems excellent. The quality of materials is mid-end, so a huge step-up from Teslas bare bones materials approach. 

Cheaper: here's another real winner. The BAAS system brought the car down to 149k RMB, or \~21k USD out the door. I will get to rent the battery for 599rmb a month and not have to worry about battery health maintenance degradation / depreciation due to outdated chemistries.

  
Convenience: battery swapping anyone? I'll also get to change pack size plans according to our needs. Long road trip coming ahead? Swap up to the larger pack by upgrading the BAAS rental package.

  
Only downside I can tell right now, production queue is advertised to a worst case of 2 months leadtime atm...

post,1fojel0,,How to measure total kWh put into an EV during a charging session?,"A recently had the battery pack in my EV (a 2014 Tesla Model S 85) replaced and am getting a sense that it either doesn't have the same capacity as the original pack or has been software-limited in some way. So my thought is to drain it down close to 0% (without actually hitting zero), then charge it up to 100%, and measuring the exact amount of electricity that goes into the vehicle. The problem is that the car itself won't tell me how many kWh got added during a charging session.

So how should I go about finding that information? Is there a monitoring device I could plug into our garage's NEMA 14-50 jack, and then plug my charger (which does not have a display) into that device to tell me this?

A mid-size SUV with a 60 kWh battery priced at just over 200,000 RMB isn't that groundbreaking. Xpeng G6 and IM LS6 are already offering similar deals.

But the BaaS option priced under 149,900 RMB is a game-changer. The mainstream market still lacks awareness of battery-swapping, and the ONVO L60 introduces this concept effectively. As Tiecheng mentioned, under the “pay for four months, get one-month free” policy, the monthly battery rental is comparable to the cost of a tank of gas. Factoring in electricity, the usage cost is on par with or even lower than a similar gas-powered SUV.

As for brand, infrastructure, and technology, NIO's backing gives ONVO a strong advantage. From a brand perception perspective, ONVO can outperform competitors.

The Model Y has long frustrated consumers, and while many cars have claimed to be ""Tesla killers,"" none have succeeded. ONVO might be the most promising contender yet.

post,1f939i5,,Experience renting EVs i4 and Ioniq 5,"I wanted to share my thoughts after test driving a few EVs over the weekend. I rented a 2023 BMW i4 and a 2022 Hyundai Ioniq 5, as I'm considering upgrading from my 2016 Honda Civic LX. Here’s my experience with each car:

**BMW i4 (Rented in January 2024)**

**Likes:**

- The interior leather and thigh extenders were a standout.

- Super quiet at sub-40 mph and still quite hushed at highway speeds over 70 mph.

- The most fun car I've ever driven, thanks to the quick torque. I even had someone try to race me on the highway!

- Mainly drove in sport mode without i-pedal/one-pedal/B-mode, and it was an engaging experience, especially with the Hans Zimmer driving sounds.

**Dislikes:**

- Poor rear visibility.

- The car felt heavy when cornering, which made it less nimble than I expected, likely because I’m used to the smaller, lighter Civic.

- The extended front made it difficult to gauge where the bumper was; I often relied on parking sensors.

- The wireless CarPlay would occasionally cut out. Since my music is downloaded, I suspect the issue was with the BMW’s connection rather than my phone.

- The interior lighting was just okay—nothing special, and I’d prefer to do a custom install for better ambiance.

- Assisted driving felt finicky and would sometimes ping-pong while trying to lane center.

- The touchscreen was confusing. I found myself constantly switching between CarPlay and other apps, which was frustrating.

- I missed having physical buttons for climate control; adjusting the settings felt like a distraction and a potential accident risk.



**Hyundai Ioniq 5 (Rented Labor Day Weekend 2024)**

**Likes:**

- Blindspot indicators on the mirrors and instrument cluster were very helpful.

- Fast charging.

- Good noise isolation, though not as good as the BMW.

**Dislikes:**

- The AC system was terrible—I was constantly adjusting it, and it even failed to start once. I had to restart the car at a red light to get it working again.

- Acceleration was ju",1725480564.0,2024-09-04 22:09:24,19,40,cam1911,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1f939i5/experience_renting_evs_i4_and_ioniq_5/,True,0.79,2024,both,search,False,False,0,
post,1f4jk8z,,2023 Mercedes EQE SUV Review: First Impressions from a Tesla Model Y Driver,"I recently took a 2023 Mercedes EQE 350+ SUV out for a spin, driving it to Canton and back to pick up some BBQ for dinner. As a current Tesla Model Y driver, I was curious to see how this luxury EV compares.

Driving Experience:
The driving experience is smooth and quiet, as you’d expect from a Mercedes. The interior is premium, with ultra-comfortable seats and a glass roof sunroof that actually opens—something I didn’t realize I missed until I had it. The stalk setup felt familiar, and I have to say, I prefer it. It’s what I’m used to, and I’m sad to see it disappearing in Tesla’s newer models, like the refreshed Model X and the “Highland” Model 3. It’s also rumored to be gone in the upcoming Juniper refresh of the Model Y. For now, though, the EQE’s stalk felt right at home.

Tech and Features:
Apple CarPlay was a novel experience, and while it’s not groundbreaking, it’s a nice feature if you’re in the Apple ecosystem. However, when it comes to tech, the EQE is far behind Tesla. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is in a league of its own—nothing Mercedes offers comes close. The EQE feels more like a luxury car that happens to be an EV, rather than a vehicle built around advanced technology.

The Mercedes smartphone app is functional but basic. It doesn’t allow your phone to act as a key, so you’re still tied to a FOB, which feels a bit dated in today’s tech-driven world.

Design and Ergonomics:
One thing I didn’t love was the abundance of physical controls, particularly on the door. There are so many controls for seat and mirror adjustments that it felt a bit cluttered. The membrane slider buttons on the steering wheel were another miss for me—they lack the tactile feedback I prefer. On the other hand, Tesla’s approach of using touchscreens for most functions is something I like better. It creates less clutter, and there are fewer things to break. Of course, this is a plus only if you love minimalism.

That said, Mercedes did get some things right. The EQ",1724982295.0,2024-08-30 03:44:55,36,122,charleshood,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1f4jk8z/2023_mercedes_eqe_suv_review_first_impressions/,True,0.61,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

Right now I’m torn between the new M3 and the BMW i4. After test driving both, the i4 is in another league. I loved it. But for my lifestyle I don’t think it’s a smart decision.

Published: August 13, 2024, 09:22
Updated: August 13, 2024, 11:02

On the 13th, Mercedes-Benz Korea will disclose information about its battery manufacturers on its website. Initially, after a fire involving one of its electric vehicles in Cheongna, Incheon, on the 1st, the company stated that it would not reveal information about its suppliers due to ""competitive reasons."" However, following continued consumer concerns, Mercedes-Benz Korea has reversed its stance.

A Mercedes-Benz Korea representative explained the decision, stating, ""In response to consumer and market demands, we have decided to disclose information about the battery cell suppliers for electric vehicles sold in Korea through our official website.""

There was significant demand among Mercedes-Benz EV owners for the disclosure of battery manufacturers. Initially, media reports suggested that the fire-stricken Mercedes EQE vehicle was equipped with CATL batteries. However, it was later revealed that the vehicle actually contained batteries from Farasis, a Chinese company ranked among the top 10 in the world.

According to the information released on Mercedes-Benz Korea's website this morning, only the ‘300’ trim of the EQE model is equipped with CATL batteries. The ‘350+,’ ‘AMG 53 4M+,’ and ‘350 4M’ trims all contain Farasis batteries. For the EQS, the ‘350’ trim uses Farasis batteries, while the other trims are equipped with CATL batteries. In the EQE SUV, the ‘500 4M’ uses Farasis batteries, while the ‘350 4M’ uses CATL batteries. Additionally, the EQC is exclusively equipped with LG Energy Solution batteries, and the EQB only uses SK On batteries. The EQA is fitted with either CATL or SK On batteries, depending on the model year.

Mercedes-Benz Korea has also agreed to comply with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s “special inspection recommendation” to conduct a full inspection of EQE vehicles reportedly equipped with Farasis batteries.

post,1eode7b,,EVs May Get Cheaper Than Gas Cars As Early As Next Year. Here’s Why,"Between 2008 and 2023, the estimated cost of a light-duty electric vehicle’s lithium-ion battery pack plummeted by 90%, going from a whopping $1,415/kilowatt-hour (adjusted for inflation) 16 years ago to a much more palatable $139/kWh last year. These estimates come from the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Vehicle Technologies Office, which added that the figures are valid for a battery pack’s usable capacity, not the rated capacity, at a production scale of at least 100,000 units per year. 

According to Goldman Sachs (via Yahoo Finance), the estimated battery cost for last year is a bit higher at $151/kWh, but what’s important here is that the same estimates show a further 40% decline in battery prices between 2023 and 2025, opening the door for much more affordable EVs that will finally undercut their gasoline counterparts and, at the same time, turn a profit for their makers. A study from the International Council On Clean Transportation previously showed that EVs will cost the same as ICE vehicles by 2029 thanks to an oversupply of lithium.

However enthusiastic these numbers are, it’s worth noting that Goldman Sachs is referring to the total cost of ownership, which includes the price of the vehicle and fuel or charging costs, as well as repairs and maintenance over the lifetime of a car. What they don’t include, however, are government subsidies such as the $7,500 federal tax credit. 

Battery costs amount to roughly one-third to one-fourth of a complete car, so it’s not the only factor at play, but it’s one of the biggest. China already figured out how to make electric cars cheaper than gas cars, albeit with heavy state incentives, but the U.S. is bound to catch up and finally offer people what they want: more affordable EVs.

Tesla is bound to launch a sub-Model 3 EV sometime next year and Ford is actively working on an affordable EV platform that will offer both a lower purchase price compared to the company’s current portfolio and a healthy profit for the ",1723243459.0,2024-08-10 00:44:19,440,229,mirrormachina,electricvehicles,https://insideevs.com/news/729153/ev-price-parity-ice-2025-2026/,False,0.94,2024,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1ej4d0j,,Neutral Setting in EVs,"Hi Guys

My friend recently bought a BYD seal EV and since I have a Tesla Model 3 Real Wheel Drive , we often discuss EV related topics , but we have some disagreement about the function of the Neutral setting in EV. Both cars use Permanent Magnet motors.

My understanding is that in a Tesla , say my RWD, the wheel is connected mechanically to a single speed reduction gearbox, which then in turn is connected to the rotor surrounded by Permanent Magnets, Because there is no true transmission in a modern electric car , there is also no true neutral mode in an EV, and the car cannot truely free wheel in neutral mode,  the moment the wheel turns, the rotor bar rotates magnetic field created by the permanent magnets, this rotating magnetic field induces a current on the outer windings in the stator, and the induced current will creates its own magnetic field that will oppose rotating PM rotor own magnetic field, allowing force to be exerted on rotor, creating drag and not allow free wheeling to take place.


My friend’s BYD seal is also a real wheel drive (AC Synchronous Permanent Magnet Motor), he says that when he put the car in neutral mode , the car free wheels like a normal combustion car, any slow down he experiences similar to how a ICE car would experience, which is to say quite minimum to the extent road surface/tyre friction would produce.(plus any air drag)

I was kind of confused by this, because I thought  as soon as he puts the BYD seal in the so called Neutral mode, his car’s momentum will still rotate the wheels, the wheels would still rotate the PM rotor, and RMF would still induce a current on the windings that, in turn, slow down the rotor, thereby slowing down the wheels , and car should come to a stop much faster than a free wheeling ICE would in neutral mode. My friend disagrees says the neutral mode in his car feels no different to his previous ICE car.

post,1e8z598,,First time driving an EV,"I was on a business trip last week (in the USA, which is where I live) and ended up renting an EV. First time after wanting to try for a while. My main worry was about charging the car and how right I was.

The driving experience was great, it gets fast very easily even for the entry range model I had (KIA Niro I assume from this year, having 1k miles on it), the regenerative braking threw me off but took half a day to get right, and it felt relaxing. I heard people say how less tiring it that a regular car and I didn’t realize what they meant until I drove this car.

Not sure what autonomous driving entails but with cruise on, stay on my lane mode and distance to the car in front adjustment, it kinda felt like it. 

About charging, the hotel where I was didn’t have any station though it said on the charging map I found it had, and charging it during the day was inconvenient and slow - the range of the chargers I found varied from maybe 30-40 miles an hour to one that charged 5 miles in 1h30… maybe I did something wrong.
Eventually I gave the car back probably 50% full because I didn’t find ways to charge it more with the time I had (AVIS tells you to bring it back 70% charged else there’s a penalty).

Overall I liked the feel and experience but need to figure out the charging because without it, I’ll keep being charged extra for giving it back half empty.

How do you guys deal with it when you can’t charge it overnight ? Can you use Tesla fast chargers for all EV? What are some tips when you’re on a road or business trip to maximize charging times ?

I’m considering getting one in the not so distant future, and also wondering how to charge at home (I’m renting a house). That’ll be the topic for a future post 😅

I carried a trailer that was 1095 lbs. and the cargo was around 1700 lbs. It was me, my significant other, a cat, and road supplies/luggage in the car. A total of around 3170 lbs. The trip did have some detours without the trailer but 98% of it was with the loaded trailer. The journey took us from Pasco, WA (South Central Washington) to Albany, NY.  The car did great pulling that weight with no issues, just had to have a little preplanning for stops each day and extra charging at each charger.

I used the ABRP app to track how much energy was using between charging and overall got the data to calculate other statistics. I had mixed results using ABRP for getting a precise range vs just using the onboard Tesla navigation. Here is my overall experience:

Model: Tesla Model Y - Long Range with factory towing

Total Travel Time: 63 h 43 min

Total Charge Time: 28 h 34 min

Energy Charged: 1583.95 kWh

How I traveled: I only ever went 65 mph, only a handful of times 70 to pass people. My travel averaged 65 mph across the board, used cruise control for the entire trip to maintain consistency. If I went over steeper inclines such as the Rockies in Colorado or Blue Mountains in Oregon, I went max 55 mph. Any faster going up steep inclines you could basically see the percentage click down every couple seconds in percentage.

ABRP app: Did not do a great job at understanding how much charge I needed between charging locations. I changed all of the information in the app including the amount of extra weight I had in the car and towing a trailer.

Tesla Navigation: The navigation did seem to get better after the first couple of charges of the first day of the trip. My first leg of the trip was over Blue Mountains in Oregon. That first leg going over the mountains was a learning curve. The car calculation was negative 27% difference from leaving the charger to the next one in Baker City, OR.

post,1dztzsu,,New US and Canadian CCS chargers in June 2024,"**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in June 2024,** according to the Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 216 CCS charging stations with a total of 517 chargepoints added or refreshed in June 2024.** For comparison, there were 304 new CCS charging stations in June 2023, with 899 chargepoints.  However, June 2023 was an exceptional month. Overall the trend seems pretty flat right now.

Some of these stations are likely to be Tesla Magic Dock stations. Previously Tesla didn't report these to the AFDC as CCS, but now they do. And that makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

It's coming for many makes and models, and for newer Ford models as well as a few other manufacturers charging at v3 and v4 Superchargers is already an option with a free adapter from the automakers. GM should release their adapter this year. But since they are not open to *all* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for non-Magic-Dock superchargers.

post,1dtzuuw,,First time in the States from EU,"Tldr:
Rented a Tesla MYLR drove from SFO-Vegas-Page AZ- South Rim GC- Vegas- SFO. Spread over 5 days. Succeeded with no real issues.

The experience was definitely better than I expected. We had two kapot chargers during the last leg of the trip but there were 10 other chargers working anyway so that was our biggest tech issue.

Had an indigestion issue too while driving but the car kept to the lane with autosteer on.

If there was anything that could have been better, I'd have three things. The windshield wash being empty. The tires were a tad bit overinflated too. The windshield definitely needed cleaning but thats more for what our videos were showing.

The car delivered and we got a great road trip too. ""Keep climate"" while in AZ baking in the sun while parked was an amazing feature!


Edit:
One more pain point. I'm 5'4"" (165cm). Those seats are too big for someone like me. Even with all the adjustments I cant really get my headrest into a comfy position. If I could take it off I would have but didnt want to break anything.

post,a3ykiq,,Tesla battery packs + cargo ship,"I was doing back of the envelope calculations this morning regarding shipping, Tesla will have to ship tons of cars to Europe until they build a Gigafactory over here, cargo ships suck because they burn bunker fuel, but is it possible to build an electric cargo ship that can go transatlantic? I think yes but maybe we need a floating solar supercharger port. I think this is the future of shipping   


[  


This ship in China can travel 50 miles with a 2400kwh battery. Thats only 24 Battery packs you would have in a Tesla. If a ship has 2000t(metric) of fuel, and a 85kwh battery pack weighs 0.54t that could be 310MWh, (I round down a lot and haven't considered the size of this 300MWh battery pack but cargo ships are HUGE so I assume its not terribly unrealistic) and assuming 2.4MWh gives us 50 miles, this ship can travel about 6,500 miles on a full charge, sounds reasonable to me!  


 And if you are shipping 2-5,000 cars cars, why not charge them fully and somehow use these to power the ship?   


Downsides:  
How long does it take to charge?   
How long until its economic?  
Did I terribly miscalculate something?

post,9pkbcf,,How do you guys justify spending so much $? I currently have a hybrid....,"So disclaimed, I have been a TSLA investor for years, have made about 10k through the rollercoaster of a stock, and a few months ago I rented a Model 3 LR while I was out in LA. It blew me away.

I'm a huge car guy, I have a classic 911 and an Audi S6 avant that's been modded; the Tesla was easily faster than both of them, and to be honest, probably handled better than both in MOST situations. My daily though, is a $3000 Honda Insight, 5spd.

I get about 52mpg with snow tires, and with summers I get around 58-65mpg at 80mph. I have a 60 mile round trip commute, so it winds up costing me ~ $3 to get to work and back, every day.

Even if I sold all my cars, and my Tesla stock, I worked out that my car payments would still be ~$200 a month.

Now, I know some of you already had leases or something, but .... I just can't see how this makes ANY financial sense. I want to contribute to the future, I believe in the mission, and I adore the car, but when you can get 60-70mpg for $3000 or so, I just cannot pull the trigger.",1539959251.0,2018-10-19 16:27:31,4,46,lakelifeisbestlife,TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/9pkbcf/how_do_you_guys_justify_spending_so_much_i/,True,0.64,2018,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kyld3i,,New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please,"TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan.

post,1kxu7oq,,First-Time EV Buyer's Guide,"I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than",1748470421.0,2025-05-29 00:13:41,92,57,chilidoggo,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/,True,0.96,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

I was really excited about the ID Buzz but I’ve realized it’s a failure in the US. Tried to capture why I think it’s failing - can informed folks please weigh in. 

1. Price. The higher trims hit mid $70K and there are just fewer customers in this segment (irrespective of brand, range etc). 
2. Range. For a car starting mid $60Ks, a range of 230 miles is just not acceptable. It’s off by a 100 miles actually. 
3. No incentives. Since this isn’t made in the U.S. Also no special lease deals in the U.S.  
4. Minivans are just not popular, especially compared to SUVs. Doesn’t matter how novel it looks. 
5. Marketing. Unfortunately, there is almost no effective marketing campaigns to promote the vehicle.

post,1kwrt8l,,New 3-row EV comparison,"Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".

post,1kw2152,,"Data after 50,000+ miles across a Bolt EUV and a Tesla Model 3","I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car. 

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV.

|**Savings ; Tax**\*\*\*|$2,076.44; $437.37|$1,454.89; $279.50|

**SAVINGS**  
*\*I benchmarked the fuel costs associated against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon but I am using nuanced* [*monthly averages for my state*]( I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".* 

*\*\*I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and* combine*d with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.* 

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured) and the heightened costs do offset the fuel-savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens up and I expect the Tesla to win out.

post,1ktff15,,"Electric trains, buses and cycles are more efficient and practical ways of electrification than electric cars!","Electric trains and buses have existed for century. Massive transit systems like Newyork Subway, London underground, Paris metro, Moscow metro, trams and trolleys have been successfully fully running electricity for nearly a century. 

India has electrified 99% of their railway network. It's 75% for china. 70% for France and Spain. 55% for Russia and Germany.

Then we come to electric bikes. They are selling a lot more than electric cars even in USA where there isn't any proper cycling infrastructure.



Trolley buses have existed for decades in many cities. From Moscow to Mexico city.

Electrification of buses with batteries are also a lot more successful than cars.




 You can have buses with much smaller batteries and use opportunity charging as buses would wait sometimes in terminal any way. Also it's much easier to implement battery swapping for buses than cars. Also in motion charging with trolley bus wires too is possible.

Then we come to resource consumption for cars vs public transportation. Let's take battery needed for electrification. Shenzen has a 100% electric bus fleet. An electric bus would mostly have 500 kWh battery pack. This can be reduced below 100 kWh by opportunity charging (like pantograph charging or battery swapping). Let's be conservative and assume you need 500 kWh battery per bus. And there is one bus per 500 residents in Shenzen. So it comes down to only 625 Wh/person. If they owned cars they would need atleast 15,000 Wh/person assuming one car with 60 kWh battery per a family of 4. This can go upto 60,000 Wh/person or even higher if there's one car per person.

You can also use trolley buses for very busy bus routes. Which would only need a very small battery.

Then the amount of infrastructure needed. One metro line with 2 track (1+1) can transportore people than a 100 lane road (50+50). One dedicated bus lane can transport more people than 6-8 lanes of cars. One cycle lane can transport as much people as a 6 lanes of cars.

post,1ksmqw7,,"Peugeot E-3008 - Review after 20,000km (12,500 miles)","**Dear fam,**

I'm living in Germany and picked up my Peugeot E-3008 (with the standard battery – 73.0 kWh net / 77.0 kWh full) back in January. I wanted to share some of my experiences so far after 20,000km. If you have any questions - feel free to ask.

For context, I previously drove mainly BMW and Audi, and I also have about two years of experience with a Tesla Model 3 LR, plus a few months each with a Polestar 2 and VW ID.4 – so those are the benchmarks I’m comparing this car to.

# Overall impression

A high-quality vehicle with an amazing interior and strong pricing, though it has some limitations when it comes to charging in winter.

# 💰 Price & Value

I don’t think many EVs can beat the price/performance ratio of this Peugeot.  
Mine is fully loaded: infotainment, panoramic roof, heated *and* cooled seats front & rear – all for just over €60K in Germany. The hardware quality is on par with VW and Polestar, slightly below Audi, but far above my 2021 Tesla Model 3.

# 🛋️ Interior

I really love it. Everything is super fast – no lag when opening maps or menus. The interface is intuitive, and shortcuts for common functions are easy to access. Took me maybe 5 minutes to get used to, and now I’m a fan. The adaptive cruise control is amazing and the best I have ever had in a car. The side assist is not ideal as the car drives slightly drunk from left to right.

# 🔊 Sound system

I love bass-heavy music – and this sound system is **insanely** loud. Honestly, you can’t even turn it all the way up unless you want your ears to bleed. The bass is punchy; Tesla probably had the stronger subwoofer, but this one comes very close – best I’ve had outside of that.

# ⚡ Charging Speed DC

post,1kqq4o9,,EV’s have been taking off in my city and I finally figured out why,"I live in a pretty rural area of western Pennsylvania and after paying a bit of attention to the specific cars around me, I got a good idea of how many EV’s were in my city. Outside of my own I had only ever really seen a couple Tesla’s but they weren’t popular. Less than 10, probably closer to 5 throughout the city. 

Over the past year there were a couple more that popped up including an EV9, and a Nissan Ariya. I’ve seen a couple chevy’s, both Blazers and equinox, and even a mustang. But the last couple months they’ve exploded. In My neighborhood there are 4 prologues out of nowhere. They’re easy to identify since I work from home and my desk is by the window near the stop sign. I always hear them as they come to a stop (the prologues are actually pretty loud with their hums) and they’re three different colors and the fourth has a bunch of decals. I’ve also seen some new blazers around. 

I stopped in at a local shop and was talking to the owner like normal and she mentioned getting a Blazer. Last person I would’ve thought, and 70+ year old lady on the verge of retirement. I asked what made her switch and she explained. She took her ICE in to get it serviced and the dealer made a new policy. Any loaner vehicle that wasn’t kept overnight required to be an EV. She said it was the safest and most comfortable she’s ever been in a car. She said she got her car back and that’s really when she felt how much she missed the car. She went back 2 weeks later to buy what she test drove. And the family that owns the dealership she goes to also owns the Honda dealership. 

That’s the biggest obstacle. Getting people to drive one, not necessarily buy them. Obviously the end goal is to buy and get more on the road, but instead of just talk talk talk, focus on just getting people to drive one. She wasn’t encouraged to buy it, just given it for a day. And that’s likely what happened with a lot of the prologues. GM and Honda are massive brands and have a lot of brand loyalty.

post,1koze73,,New US and Canadian CCS chargers in April 2025,"Hey electrons,

**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in April 2025,** according to the US Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 300 CCS charging stations with a total of 986 chargepoints added or refreshed in April 2025.** For comparison, there were 264 new CCS charging stations in April 2024, with 797 chargepoints.

This month saw an increase relative to April of last year, and also an increase relative to last month, especially with regard to chargepoints. Looking at the data, I cast side-eye on a few of the largest numbers, but overall it looks plausible.

Note that several of these are Tesla Superchargers with Magic Dock. This has a significant influence especially on the number of total chargepoints.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers still do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but any that are shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle. **Be aware some stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,** which require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers. Newly listed ones here probably have long cords, but you might want to test them out when it's not Christmas Eve.

I've been curious about whether ""highway miles"" apply to electric vehicles, particularly Teslas, in the same way they do for gas cars. 

In gas cars, highway miles tend to put less strain on the engine because you're not constantly stopping and going, which makes the engine work harder. Does this concept hold true for electric vehicles as well? For instance, if you come across a 2023 with 80k miles on it, would you be less concerned about the wear and tear on the battery and motors?

post,1kncbf5,,Anyone running off-grid solar without a battery to charge their EV?,"(EDIT: added reasons for off grid, no battery) I’m exploring a setup to charge a Tesla directly from off-grid solar **without any battery buffer** (longer story below why it has to be that way...) — just solar panels (approx. 9 panels at 360-400W on a virtually flat, unshaded roof in NorCal), a grid-forming inverter, and something like OpenEVSE to manage charge rate based on available solar.

Looking for input from anyone who’s done this:

* What gear are you using?
* How reliable is charging (especially with variable sun on cloudy days)?
* Any automation tips to avoid inverter overload?
* Lessons learned?

Trying to build a lean system with no battery bank — would love to hear from others who’ve made it work (or tried and gave up).

  
Reasons for off grid and no battery: This is for an HOA garage w common electricity, grid tying it would have virtually no positive impact for me.  I have one bay and am looking into having solar panels on the roof above my spot. There is no room for a battery inside my allocated part of the garage, also some members have expressed concerns about having batteries so I would have to go through the process of convincing them. I am looking at this as a simple(?) way to trickle charge without having to pay for a separate metered connection (requirement from HOA if I grid tie) as well as PG&E rates. By not grid tying I am also hoping for a faster permitting process.

post,1kkz0d5,,No more simple creep mode?,"It seems unexpectedly hard to get a new EV that creeps, but also regens and holds without disrupting creep maneuvers (like only on hard brake), without lots of toggling. What's wrong with the creep mode? To us it's very useful maneuvering tight parking lots and ramps.

We test drove several EV SUVs and found that new Teslas (X/Y) actually removed the creep mode, while Rivians (R1S) don't have one to start with. The BMW (iX) creeps okay in D/R mode, but the Auto Hold is much more sensitive than our old Tesla (where it requires a hard brake), and can't be released with another brake, so we still have to tap the gas pedal sometimes (say after checking obstacles or waiting for pedestrians) which feels more jerky, or temporarily turn off the Auto Hold. And can't remember if the Volvo (EX90) works as we want - maybe the creep mode wasn't compatible with full regen or something.

We have been driving the old Tesla for six years with regen + creep (basically trending towards 5mph) + hold (on hard brake) all working simultaneously, and the parking lot maneuver with one-brake-pedal-driving is super smooth. We tried for a week to get used to the gas pedal Hold mode but still found it not as precise in tight spaces/ramps, and almost hit a wall once being too used to full press the current pedal during parking.",1747072182.0,2025-05-12 19:49:42,18,251,lxtbell2,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kkz0d5/no_more_simple_creep_mode/,True,0.59,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,1kkqny7,,Circle K Troubles in Virginia,"I had a poor initial experience at a Circle K EV Charging station in Wytheville, Virginia. I had planned to stop there as that was the most convenient stopping point on our return trip home. The Equinox EV mapped it out and accurately estimated we'd have 20% charge left arriving at the station. When I pulled up, none of the stations were being used. I already had the app set up prior to the trip with my credit card added and approved.

The first issue was how difficult it was to physically pull the cord to my vehicle, which was parked fully up in the spot on the correct side and about 10 feet from the station. The cable that secured the cord  was so resistant, I had to put it over my shoulder and lean forward and grind step-by-step to my vehicle's outlet. I'm no he-man, at about 162 pounds, but I know this was too tight. And later I found the cable securing the other plug was also just as tight. When you plug it into the vehicle, you can feel how strong the tension is pulling against the cable. I was sure the plug would be yanked back out just by the tension alone.

The next issue I had was getting the app to communicate with the charger. I kept pushing start on my app, but it didn't do anything. All it did was tell me to follow the instructions on the charging station monitor. I needed a few minutes of charging at least, so I threw my hands up and went to the charging terminal and followed the instructions, paying with my card via google pay which then dinged me for a $50 pre-approval because I wasn't using the app. The charging station clicked loudly and finally began charging.

After five minutes the charging stopped telling me there was an issue with the charging unit. I unplugged and then plugged the other charging cable in. Went through the start-up process again, and again, the app wasn't allowing me to start the session. Another $50 pre-approval, and the unit was charging again.

post,1kkip0q,,Test drove the 2026 Cadillac Vistiq and was impressed,"We are considering replacing a BMW X5 with an EV and have been investigating the various options.  The X5 is my wife's daily driver, and she drives 5-6K miles annually.  My daily driver is a Tesla Model S Plaid, and we have 3 other ICE cars.

Drove a black on black Vistiq Sport today, and quite frankly it is probably our favorite option among the various 3 rows - R1S, Model X, Model Y, Kia EV9, and Volvo EX90 which we haven't driven yet.

What we liked:

1. What a great size, much more reasonable than the enormous 3 row Escalade IQ, but roomier than Model X.  Similar length to the R1S, but the second row legroom was better than R1S.  3rd row is passable for smaller kids, and larger ones with a cooperative second row occupant.
2. A pano sunroof that opens in an EV - wow! Also, an extra small glass roof over the 3rd row is a nice touch.
3. Great second row captains chairs!  I wish others did this as well!
4. Interior is very quiet, and ride very smooth, which is preferable for my wife's casual driving style.  It's definitely towards the isolated luxury side of the spectrum.  The sport mode makes an obvious difference on the dampers, but we won't be driving a heavy 3 row EV as a sports car anyway.  Body motions were well controlled for daily stuff.
5. The ""hip point"" for the front seats seemed pretty high, though the step in height is reasonably low.  It's an upright seating position with a commanding view.
6. Power is generous at 615HP.  Press V mode on the wheel and you get it all.  Very fast for a machine of this size.
7. Beautiful interior design, and material choices seemed high quality.  Very pretty.
8. The 80K base price, while a bit high, includes everything we'd want, including a banger of an AKG sound system.

Dislikes:

1. I don't like the position of the charge port on the front fender.  Wish it was at the rear.
2. A 2026 should have a native NACS port at this point.  C'mon GM.

Context: China's electrified (""NEV"") car market [grew 34% in the past year]( (April 2025 vs April 2024), with competitive local brands enjoying similarly strong growth.

Tesla’s China numbers: in contrast to the booming market, Tesla’s “retail sales” (ie: local Chinese sales; not including exports from the Shanghai factory) in China reached 163,338 in Jan-Apr 2025, which is down 0.3% from 163,841 in Jan-Apr 2024:

post,1kjsbh6,,GM Uses Elderly Men To Test Their NACS EV’S,"Was at my closest Tesla Supercharger when I saw an elderly gentleman get out of his 2025 Cadillac Optiq. He looked visibly confused about how to pull the plug from the charging port. I went over to help, but he explained the best he could that he needed to wait until the charging port light turned red before pulling it. I was confused, but I took it as a polite “I don’t need help” and went on my way.

The car had a giant yellow warning label saying not to pull the plug before stopping the charge, and I noticed a strange-looking folder sitting on his dash. I thought there was no way this guy was testing the system as an employee, so I brushed it off and walked into a nearby store.

When I came back out, I saw another very elderly man pull into the same Supercharger in a similar Optiq. This man looked even more confused, but after a while, he managed to plug the port in. That is when I noticed the dedicated NACS port built right into the Optiq. I knew GM was testing them, but this was the first time I had seen one in real life.

What really caught my attention was that GM seemed to be using very old men, quite literally struggling to walk and talk, to test these vehicles. This second man also had that same weird folder on his dash. Interestingly, the first vehicle did not have a manufacturer plate, but the second one did, which added to the mystery.

It was a strange and interesting encounter, and I figured it was worth sharing.",1746936478.0,2025-05-11 06:07:58,632,174,TheSadLifeOfADreamer,electricvehicles,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjsbh6,False,0.95,2025,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,k2pk53,,"You've seen 40-80, now here's a comprehensive 60-100 mph list","I should note that these aren't ""true"" 60-100 mph tests. These results are taken from the 0-[end of run] tests from various car magazines. Typically, magazines will run three acceleration tests: 0-60, 0-100, and the quarter mile. All of these data points will come from the same run (or an average of a few runs). 

Thus, the 60-100 time is simply the time it takes to go from 60 mph to 100 mph *while already accelerating*. In my opinion, a ""true"" 60-100 test would have the car cruising at 60 mph in an optimal gear and then goosing it from there. 

Enjoy.

post,jxt5tz,,3 Years with a Chevy Bolt,"I'm getting ready to turn in my Chevy Bolt after a 3 year lease, so I thought I'd share my thoughts on the ownership experience after 38,000 miles...

**Typical Commute:** 70 mile roundtrip in heavy traffic (suburban, stop-and-go highway, and urban), around 3 hours a day

**Environment:** Garage with 220V Level 2 charger, outdoor temps ranging between -20F and 100F

**Pros!**  EV powah, range, heated steering wheel, ride, steering, visibility, interior space, Apple CarPlay, low maintenance needs, relatively quiet

**Cons!**  Front wheel traction, the seats, HVAC, stupid GM things, weak switchgear, dopey styling

&#x200B;

I rage quit a BMW i3 after waking up to a fully-charged car with only 50 total miles on a 10F day.  Having to stop at a Level 3 DC charger every day for 20 minutes was getting old real fast when my commute home was already over an hour every day, so I test drove a Chevy Bolt and liked it enough to lease one for 3 years/15,000 miles a year.  I was planning to go over my mileage on the lease and backfill the difference with my Boxster, but my job ended up being converted to a WFH position last year.

Overall it's been a good experience.  I can't say I've had any moments where I looked forward to driving it, but I do catch myself from time to time thinking about how nice it is to drive.  The heated steering wheel is so, so nice on cold days and Apple CarPlay works flawlessly after a couple of iOS updates.  The maintenance schedule for the car has 3 total items: tire rotation, cabin air filter, and battery coolant flush at 150k miles.  I've done all of the tire rotations in my own garage and had the cabin air filter replaced at its only dealer visit for a software recall.

Electric range has been a non-issue with this car, the first time this has happened with any of my previous EVs.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've stopped at a public charger.

post,jwk3hi,,How to Send a Land Rover Defender Through a Car Wash?,"UPDATE 2-9-2021: Sorry for belated response! I never got notice of any replies or that this went live. 

Unfortunately we're all still confounded as to what to do about this vehicle. I tried shifting it into neutral and exiting from the passenger side, and that did work, but it's too risky to keep doing since my foot could bump the shifter on the way over. (Also, we can't simply shut the vehicle off either, as that will still trigger brake-hold and the parking gear.) 

I tried calling a dealership since my boss told me they should know since the vehicle has to be kept in neutral to do a wheel alignment (which I assume is done without someone staying in the driver seat), but they told me they didn't know either. I read through the relevant portions of the manual about brake-hold and whatnot, and saw no actionable advice.

We'll just have to keep sending employees through with the car until a solution pops up, but these new features can sure cause problems. The Model X and Y from Tesla, for instance, tends to lock if you leave all the doors closed for a few minutes, even with the card key inside. We had to have one customer unlock it with their phone app about five  times. 

-----

I work at an automatic car wash, and we're stumped as how to send a Land Rover Defender (2019-2020 model years) safely through without necessitating someone sitting in the driver seat. 

For cars that go through without a person in them, we leave them running while in neutral gear, and some vehicles have electronic shifters that require specific processes so that they don't shift (and stay) in park or activate a brake when you open the driver door. 

For instance, we have to put Teslas in tow or transport mode, and leave the driver seat belt buckled on Dodge Ram trucks with dial shifters, but none of our tricks work on the Defender so far. The parking brake stays on, and will reactivate itself immediately if you try to shut it off.

post,iry6hv,,"I drove the Porsche Taycan 4S for an hour, and here are my thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of it against all the Tesla I’ve driven.","Due to some luck I had a [Porsche Taycan 4S]( all to myself for about an hour. As a big fan of both Tesla and Porsche, I've driven many of the modern Porsches and I've driven almost all of the Tesla models (including all Performance Model S/3/X except the OG Roadster and the Model Y. I currently DD an AWD Model 3 with acceleration boost. Here are some of my thoughts on many of the aspects of the Taycan from the perspective of a long time Tesla driver.

**Exterior design**: It's all subjective, but I think it's one of the two best looking 4 door sedan on the planet right now, EV or otherwise. Small details like the headlights just really sets it apart from the competition.

**Powertrain**: The 4S is the ""slowest"" Taycan model at *only* 3.8s 0-60. But in typical Porsche fashion it's probably a little quicker than that. It launches slightly harder than my Model 3 (3.9s 0-60 according to Tesla) but definitely won't blow away anyone who's been driving any of the Performance Tesla models. One thing I both liked and disliked was the two-gear transmission. On one hand it pulls hard at speed well north of 70mph (far quicker than my Model 3 at that speed) but despite how amazing PDK is in their ICE cars, that one shift just feels *jarring* in the context of an EV. It's barely noticeable but once you notice it, it's hard to ignore. 

Additionally, it doesn't regen nearly as hard as Tesla does when you lift foot off the throttle, that may be jarring for some EV owners but since I often drive ICE sports cars on weekends it didn't bother me. However I prefer Tesla's implementation as far as an EV experience goes.

**Handling/Chassis/Steering**: The unit I drove had PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) and All Wheel Steering, but did not have the physics defying electromechanical anti-roll bar system.

post,inttgt,,1 year review 2019 Tesla Model 3 (From a non-Tesla fan/follower),"Hey everyone, I have been on the fence about doing this review since I know there is a bit of a stigma behind the brand. I decided to do it to give people some perspective on it who are in the market for a Tesla, but also don't want to hear the glory and gospel of the brand like a religion. For starters, this car is a result of me compromising with my parents since I live with them, help take care of them in their old age, and wanted a car for them to be able to drive and enjoy. This was a car that was NOT on my list of cars to purchase, but because of what my parents wanted was very different from what I wanted, I compromised and this ended up being a choice. The option I chose was a long range rear wheel drive (now discontinued) and out the door after taxes, was around $55k (for those of you interested, I financed through my bank since Tesla's rates kind of suck). [Some pics here when it first came in.]( Excuse the mess since the garage wasn't cleaned up yet after selling my old car.

# ""Dealership"" experience/delivery:

So as many of you know, there is no dealership. You come into the store, test drive (you must schedule for it), sit down with an associate, talk options, talk financing/lease options, you put your down payment, and you are given an email to wait for your delivery date. This was before covid, so things are much different now. I wasn't treated the best either, but that's partially down to my age, stereotypes with my ethnicity, I won't go into the long winded story about it. However I can say that it's a somewhat messy system when I was going through it. For one, the delivery date is given to you when the car comes in and you're given only a few select days to pick it up. Just a phone call which looking back, isn't the greatest method. None of the dates they offered me worked with my schedule so I had my parents go pick it up, since they needed to demo the features, keys (cards), etc. So, not the best, but certainly not the worst I've exper",1599425796.0,2020-09-06 22:56:36,119,49,rx-pulse,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/inttgt/1_year_review_2019_tesla_model_3_from_a_nontesla/,True,0.91,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,gkdgwz,,Which car YouTubers do you love and why?,"A positive contrast to [the other thread]( as is reddit tradition. Which channels make videos that you always watch to completion? The smaller the better.

---

1. [Autogefuehl]( is *the best* review channel. Rather than just hopping in and excitedly reading you the dealership brochure, the host discusses materials, ergonomics, visibility, things that a prospective owner would actually care about after the dealership experience has ended. Above all, it is presented calmly and plainly. 

1. [Petrolicious]( has moved to a subscription-based model but still puts out a ton of free content that is by far the best automotive cinematography on YouTube. Voiceovers are done by owners of the cars featured, and are typically in a much more comfortable storytelling/interview format.

1. [TheStraightPipes]( is my favorite ""YouTuber"" channel. Their editing is consistently commercial quality, and I really enjoy their formula of how the video is paced, what each host discusses, visor test/box test/etc. When they discuss styling or color options, it's the usual ""wow looks aggressive/soft/sleek/whatever"" but they back up the opinion with quick animations or cutting to a shot of whatever feature gives it that quality. It's a minor thing but it seems rare that YouTubers actually put in the effort to give visuals to show what they're talking about.

2. [Bad Obsession Motorsport]( is my favorite fabrication channel. Presented without further comment- if you know, you know.

1. [Aging Wheels]( is another great ""actually working on cars"" channel. Pacing is a little slower and less fabrication is shown on camera, but he does a much wider variety of content and all of it is watchable and enjoyable.

1. [PapadakisRacing]( has been putting out some fantastic videos of building their 1000HP A90 Supra. Likely the best complex-topic-explained-simply content I've seen on automotive youtube.

3. [Speedkar99]( is my favorite informative channel. No flashy intro and no sponsorships, he gets right dow",1589563690.0,2020-05-15 19:28:10,105,199,mazdayasna,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/gkdgwz/which_car_youtubers_do_you_love_and_why/,True,0.81,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,f07wod,,I picked up my new Jaguar I-Pace last week!,"*(Reposting due to the last post being removed due to mentioning a certain other brand.)*

As per the title, last week I traded in my F-Pace for an I-Pace, and after a week I am loving the car! 

[Pictures first if people don't want to read.](

------
**Why an I-Pace?**

I am obviously a fan of Jaguars, having gone from an XKR to an F-Type as the 'fun car' and from an F-Pace to an I-Pace as a daily driver, but before pulling the trigger I definitely did try to shop around, I looked at an E-Tron and a Model S or Model X.

**(Obvious EV Alternative)** I really do love (Obvious EV Alternative), and through my job I have spent *a lot* of time in various (Obvious EV Alternative) - and when I knew that I was going to go electric I really did think I was going to go with (Obvious EV Alternative), mainly because of the technology and the supercharger network.

**E-Tron** I used to be an Audi guy, and before the Jags I had 2 A4s and a Q7, so I naturally went back in to look at the E-Tron, and I must say I wasn't that impressed. The quality was far superior to (Obvious EV Alternative), but in my opinion isn't quite as nice as the I-Pace, and the range was a factor. (Also how uneducated the salesman are about EVs in Audi put me off, one told me that the car could only charge at 3 miles per hour maximum, he clearly didn't know about fast chargers!) 

**I-Pace** The I-Pace seemed like a good compromise over the Model X, it is a bit smaller, but it is considerably cheaper than a Model X. I don't do enough driving to really make use of the Supercharger network, and there is enough tech to keep me entertained (such as lane keep assist etc.) 

----

**Impressions**

Now I have had the car for a week, I have definitely had some first thoughts on the car. The biggest one for me is that range really is nothing to worry about (well for me anyway.) I am moving house soon, so I haven't bothered fitting a home charger, and I am relying on the 'granny plug' (3-pin plug) and even with that '",1581065738.0,2020-02-07 09:55:38,71,29,jamievisive,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/f07wod/i_picked_up_my_new_jaguar_ipace_last_week/,True,0.88,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,kkz8n9,,There is nothing wrong with preferring automatic gearboxes to a manual (and similar gripes),"I have seen this said a few times on reddit / as well as an equal amount of *""to hell with the slushboxes""* posts and comments making enthusiasts feel less included because of their preference of gearbox technology.

 I think it needs to be said outright that if you do not like manuals / prefer and automatic - you are no less of an enthusiast as the guy with save the manuals stickers and a slightly larger left leg.

Now I drive a manual. A 5 speed e46. With it's quirks it is a great gearbox and incredibly fun to drive. Driving through the twisties in the mountains racking through the gears and revmatching before coming around a bend is very rewarding. If I were to purchase a true sports car - such as a miata, elise, or brz / similar. A manual would be required, but..

Every time I drive a car with an auto I think *""Hmm. This is nice.""* and that is in a minivan with a gearbox that takes 3 seconds to step down.

Comparatively auto gearbox technology has gotten incredible. 10 speed boxes that seamlessly switch gears and step down immediately are becoming a norm in sporty oriented cars. For a practical and fun car a gearbox like this can be much more livable than a manual for many people.

Now dual clutch technology - that is quite incredible. Instantaneous seamless shifts that are controlled by the operator but can also be controlled automatically through driver modes. A direct connection to the drivetrain rather than through a torque converter. In any car short of a automobiles that are purposefully engineered to provide a classic sports coupe / roadster experience - this is my ideal gearbox.

The car community is one of the most wonderful, most inclusive communities I have had the pleasure to be part of - but people like automobiles for all sorts of reasons. Some people like them because they are fun to drive - others like them because they are an engineering tour de force. Others because they provide them with great memories, and some just because they are a nice pl",1609052524.0,2020-12-27 08:02:04,5594,1371,DamnitDean,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/kkz8n9/there_is_nothing_wrong_with_preferring_automatic/,True,0.87,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,ki7w2d,,"Unpopular Opinion: I'm tired of reading about cars that are near-unobtainable for normal, middle class people, or are barred by international sales.","As the titles states, it's become exhausting as a car fan as this paradox builds (this is coming from an American, so I can only speak from that perspective):

* Tech and engineering have created some stellar, incredible cars in recent memory. Most of them starting around a mere ^(chokes on coffee) $45-60k. Performance is the most available it's ever been. 
* Many affordable, fun to drive cars are in the sub, micro, compact, coupe, hatch, wagon and roadster categories—all of which are beloved car classes in this sub and on many forums. Unfortunately, the US market has only two loves: SUVs and trucks. Period. They outsell everything else combined *times two*. Auto makers in the US have no interest in bringing quick, zippy, fun to drive cars here, and market research supports that. 
* ""Affordable"" cars tend to be dogs. Minus a handful of standouts (Fit, 3, etc.) you're still paying around $15k+ starting for an econobox that has mediocre performance and odds are... won't scratch the itch of an ""enthusiast"".
* Most importantly: **Cars cost more. Inflation is nuts, wages are stagnant, the used market is bananas**. 

So where does that leave we armchair car lovers? We watch from the sidelines, single tear down cheek, hoping one day we could even sit in an Audi—let alone own an S7? I'd settle for the Yaris GR that we hear about *constantly* that we'll never get. Or a Civic Type R that a dealer will mark up to over $40k after tax, though even that's more than a lot of us make in a year. 

Either way—it's rough being a fan of these cars sometimes. The best way I can put it is that being a car enthusiast is like being one of those celebrity gossip lovers. It's like, you know you'll never meet Clooney, but *oooooh* you just heard some juicy deets about him and the maid, or what Armani suit he owns now, or how much his new mansion is.

post,ki734z,,12 Days of Chrysler's Final Decade Christmas: The Dodge Viper,"Intro: 

------

The [first generation Dodge Viper]( is probably the most American vehicle ever made. I say that because well, [it literally is,]( but also because it’s excessive. The engine that powered it, an [8.0-liter, 400-horsepower V10]( whose block was cast by Lamborghini, was the largest engine in any American car at the time, and indeed one of the largest ever fitted to any production car. Despite this 750-pound lump of an all-aluminum engine, the Viper had seats for just a driver and a passenger. 

It was meant to be a modern interpretation of the Shelby Cobra, and seeing as Carroll Shelby was still around at the time, he was involved in the development of the vehicle. He wasn’t the one running the show, however. That was Bob Lutz.

Lutz, responsible for all of [the weird performance trims on pre-bailout GM cars,]( decided it was time Chrysler employees and engineers got a break from seeing the otherwise boring cars Chrysler was making at the time. The chief engineer of the [captivating prototype car,]( Roy Sjoberg, was instructed to put together a small team of engineers to make that dream car a reality. 

Iacocca initially didn’t want to cough up the change for it, however. He was still upset about his [failed TC project]( and wasn’t about to shell out a bunch of cash for something that sounded awfully similar. However, he was eventually swayed, and gave Lutz a paltry—in automotive development terms—$70 million ($110 million in 2008 dollars) to get the car into production. For context, the Pontiac Solstice program cost in the neighborhood of $250 million in 2008, and that’s still considered cheap today.

Lutz managed to get the car so cheap by embracing the “Skunkworks” approach to development, an approach that, if you know what you’re doing, can bear some serious fruit. Basically, Lutz and his chief engineer worked directly with the small yet powerful groups of individuals that were essential to the vehicle getting produced, including designers, enginee",1608649754.0,2020-12-22 16:09:14,308,60,Aelmay,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/ki734z/12_days_of_chryslers_final_decade_christmas_the/,True,0.97,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,
post,keyzfj,,Twelve Days of Chrysler's Final Decade Christmas: The Plymouth Prowler,"[The Prowler]( comes in right at the end of the period of independent Chrysler, and like [other lower-production retro-styled cars from the era,]( it’s like heroin for boomers. Based on a design study by none other than Chip Foose, it was styled to look like a classic roadster from the 1930s, and it does play the part of such a roadster well.

It has completely exposed front suspension, a long narrow hood, and a big honking… 3.5 liter V6. Yes, if you weren’t aware—you likely are aware—this car isn’t V8 powered. Despite getting everything *else* right about making a modern interpretation of a classic American roadster, that one detail was seemingly forgotten about. 

The car’s designers justify it by saying that the design came ahead of all other things, and that accommodating a larger V8 engine would’ve meant altering the design, which would’ve compromised the entire ethos behind the project. I think this is a pretty good justification. 253 horsepower is plenty for a car weighing just 2,800 pounds as the Prowler does, but it’s just not going to be the fastest thing in the world. It doesn’t help that all Prowlers were equipped with four-speed automatics, either—Even if they were mounted at [the back of the car for better weight distribution.](

It’s a little awkward, then, that people have since swapped V8s into these cars without altering the body. One guy even swapped a Hellcat motor into one, which my editor Kyle wrote about back in 2018. Unfortunately I don’t think I can link back to it without breaking the self-promotion rules.

In any case, the Prowler arrived at dealerships in 1997 priced at about $62,100 in 2020 dollars, which is a *lot* of money for a toy like this. It was also only available in one color called “Prowler Purple,” which—while it’s definitely a great color—couldn't hide the anemic drivetrain underneath. Later cars had the 253-hp aluminum V6, the early cars had an iron block version of the same engine, except it only made 214 horsepower.

post,kcz8z4,,Twelve Days of Chrysler's Final Decade Christmas: The Chrysler TC by Maserati,"[Lee Iacocca]( was a very interesting character, and indeed will be a recurring one in this series as he was Chrysler’s president from 1978 to 1992. His father operated a hot dog stand [(which is actually a chain still in business today),]( but Lee—His actual first name is “Lido”—would go on to become one of the most successful business leaders in American history. 

Even Lee Iacocca made mistakes, however. One of those mistakes—a convertible sports car made in “collaboration” with Maserati—was born of Iacocca’s fondness for his parent’s nation of origin, Italy. The [Chrysler TC by Maserati]( was, by all accounts, a waste of time and money, but that just makes it all the more interesting today.

According to Bob Lutz, an executive at Chrysler at the time, Iacocca actually intended to buy out Maserati, but for one reason or another, only got the rights to use the name alongside Chrysler’s, hence “TC by Maserati,” and the [strange Trident-within-Pentastar logo]( that was affixed to every vehicle. Such an unusual cultural crossover.

The partnership was also not really a two way street. Basically, Chrysler made all of the parts for the cars and then shipped them to Turin, Italy, where the vehicles were nailed together at Maserati’s decrepit factory. The facilities had to be upgraded to even make the cars, which happened on Chrysler’s dime, of course.

Despite the inefficient and costly arrangement, the cars did, eventually, begin to roll off the line and get shipped to the United States. Iacocca was ecstatic about it. He said that the car would be “the prettiest Italian to arrive stateside since his mother immigrated,” and expected sales to be excellent. 

The TC itself was not excellent, however. Initially powered by a turbocharged 2.2-liter inline-four producing 160 horsepower, it was slow. It was also—despite its two seats and roadster looks—front wheel-drive. The TC was, after all, on the K-platform along with about 600 other makes and models under the umbrella of ",1607958200.0,2020-12-14 16:03:20,760,103,Aelmay,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/kcz8z4/twelve_days_of_chryslers_final_decade_christmas/,True,0.97,2020,tesla,search,False,False,0,

post,inmlri,,"After searching months for a nice, comfortable cruising coupe, this is what I ended up with......","TL;DR - [Please welcome my new Camaro](

&#x200B;

Hi r/cars!

&#x200B;

3 years ago I leased a grabber blue Ecoboost Mustang as my first car. As my lease was running out, I started looking for a replacement vehicle. My requirements were simple, or so I thought:

* 2 doors
* Not black, white, silver, or gray (but if I see a good deal, I'll just get it and wrap it)
* Ideally not a 4 cylinder
* Comfortable, not back breaking ride
* heated seats at minimum, hopefully cooled seats too
* Ideally Android Auto support.
* $30 - 50k Canadian

Essentially, I'm looking for a GT coupe.

&#x200B;

When I started looking a few months ago, I started with the Lexus RC300. In red, and F-sport 2, the car is beautiful. Unfortunately, in AWD and with Lexus' 6 speed torque converter, the car felt slow as hell. The v6 Lexus uses in the 300 is a detuned 350. The car just drove so poorly, it legitimately felt worse than my Ecoboost Mustang, by far. People tell me the 350 is better, but the car IMO carries its weight poorly, and the transmission is slow - Not something an extra 40hp can fix.

&#x200B;

Infiniti Q60 Red Sport was next. I found a nice example that's 2 year old for around \~$38k. The engine was a gem, but the transmission was anemic, and the infotainment was just horrifying. The car actually looks really nice both inside and outside, but I'd rather get something with functional and smooth infotainment. I also can't love that steering, somehow it just feels too heavy for the non-existent feedback the car had. Goddamnit, if I wanted a car with no steering feel, at least make it effortless like the old El Dorados!

&#x200B;

Mercedes E550 coupe was the next car I considered. I really liked the E class coupe, especially the frameless window and the huge sunroof. However, the problem is that there's only 1 model year of E class coupe I really am interested in, the 2016 E550 with Luxury package. A late model year 2016 has android auto, and the luxury package adds cooled seats.

post,ihiy8n,,Making a tesla roadster with today's technology,"Im not talking about the upcoming, bells and whistles roadster with rocket boosters and such.

The original roadster was based on a lotus, had a 53 kwh battery and had an EPA rating of 250 miles, thought this was with the 2 cycle test, not the 5 cycle test the EPA uses now, which is harder. tested today, its more likely the Roadster had a 5 cycle EPA test range of 200 miles.

According to wikipedia, the battery PACK density was rated at 117wh/kg (cell density would be much higher)

does anyone know what the pack density  of teslas currently are? 

I've heard rumours of 160wh/kg. which would give a roadster of today, with a 53kwh battery pack a 260 mile plus EPA rating roughly speaking.

that would give the roadster a 337kg battery, eeking out a bit more range due to weight savings or even space with a slightly smaller battery pack

I wish this car could be made now. it would be in the range of BMW Z4, Porshe Boxter,

But the reality is it will never be mae as the market for convertible coupe's is tiny, even if the technology is there.

Information | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:

Cumulative Production | 50 | 219 | 1174 | 5940 | 17757 | 38289

So, previously, when Elon tweeted:

[""Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500.""](

[""Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec""](

There were [some]( [number]( [of]( [posts]( trying to chart the Model 3 production ramp.

So during the July 28 Model 3 Handover event, we all saw [this chart]( as one of Elon's slides. I hoped someone would try to pull numbers from the chart to validate Elon's previous tweets, but didn't manage to find any posts in /r/teslamotors trying to do this (or maybe I'm just bad at searching).

So what else to do but to [be the change you wish to see in the world]( Tesla posted the video of the handover event to Facebook yesterday (not sure if Facebook links are allowed here) so I took a screenshot of the chart at the moment the slide was shown.

I randomly used [the first graph-to-data tool]( I could find that was a web tool and didn't require me to download anything (because I'm lazy) and it automatically extracted 134 data points off of the imprecise image of the screenshot of the slide of the chart. I then did some very basic linear interpolation between data points in Excel to derive the monthly production numbers you see above. I [re-graphed the data in Plotly]( so you can interactively view the data points on the chart. But I forgot to include July's 50 cars in the plot and am lazy to change it.

A lot of caveats, assumptions and crude methods used here. Obviously, take this with a grain of salt because of the sheer sensitivity of the method to small positional adjustments in pixels.

post,6qb10q,,RHD info and rough UK Pricing of the Model 3 and different options,"Ok, having been around for the delivery event and seeing the US page for the Model 3 it is clear that RHD Model 3 cars wont be manufactured till Q1 2019 :   

If we take Elon's previous tweet about the price of the Model 3 in Australia ( and apply that with the different options we can work out what the total costs of the car with each option available (Ill use UK pricing as an example with rounded figures, USD to GBP using Google):  

-------------------  
Model 3 Pricing (UK, before incentives):  

Standard Battery  
Starting at :  
£26650 + 10% import tax + 20% VAT = **£35200**  
*Range of 220 miles  
  
------------------------    
  
“Long Range Battery”  
Starting at :  
£33503.39 + 10% Import Tax + 20% VAT = **£44250**  
*Range of 310 miles   
  
  
Options:  
*The Premium upgrade package is £4600  
*Enhanced Autopilot is £4700 (£5700 after delivery)  
*Full Self Driving is £2800 (£3800 after delivery)  
  
A fully kitted out Model 3 (no AWD) would cost in the region of :  

£44250 + £4600 + £4700 + £2800 =   
  
**£56350**  

Note:  AWD is expected to cost £5000  
Note2:  We do not know what the UK Government will do with the EV Incentive program in 2018/2019, but you can apply the £4500 grant as an estimate to the above prices to reduce prices to £30700, £41750 and £51850.",1501335879.0,2017-07-29 15:44:39,6,13,Sonicsteel,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6qb10q/rhd_info_and_rough_uk_pricing_of_the_model_3_and/,True,0.99,2017,both,search,False,False,0,

They were kind of down around 9th place or so this morning and over a few minutes they rocketed up to second place. The vast majority of the likes are from Russian twitter accounts that were just created, have 0 followers, and are consistently ""liking"" the same posts and content. I suppose there's a scenario where the likes weren't purchased specifically for this entry and that bots have targeted it for one reason or another. In any case, it has completely skewed the votes. Hopefully Tesla does something about it, because it's tainting what has otherwise been a great contest.

I've posted some screen grabs of the types of activity associated with that entry:


It's also worth mentioning that it has very few comments on the tweet, whereas the other entries with a solid amount of votes have 5x-10x the amount of comments (whether they be good or bad). That also suggests that most of the Likes aren't coming from legit people.

I hate to say that there's yet another Russian voting scandal, but is there any other way to interpret what we're seeing?

I've added a another screengrab with analytics on a handful of the retweets:

Confirmed by Elon and Tesla:

post,6ph1lc,,Cost of the Model 3 outside the US,"Today, Elon tweeted this : 

If we take that math for other countries outside the US, we can get a nice estimate on local pricing for the very base model of the Model 3.  

With that in mind, ill do a quick calculation for the UK :

* $35000 = £26838.43  (with current exchange rates, thanks Google)
* Import tax in the UK is ~10% = 2683.84 + 26838.43 = £29522.27
* Sales tax = VAT @ 20% = 5904.45  +  29522.27 = £35426.70

So I can assume that before government incentives, (rounded figures) that the Model 3 will be £35500.

Now the UK has an incentive of up to £4500 grant from the government for Electric Vehicles, Tesla are fully electric with a high milage and get the full amount.  Therefore I can assume that I would pay, for a base model, (rounded figures again) in the region of £31000.

He also optimistically said that three months ago features ""maybe"" would begin to diverge, but I'll give him a pass on that.

Most people who have both AP1 and AP2 cars seem to be of the opinion that AP2 hasn't quite caught up to AP1 yet (not to mention the missing features like rain-sensing wipers and a display that shows multiple lanes and bikes.)

We all know that Elon is overly optimistic on his timelines, but how much padding is appropriate?  Is another six months enough time for Tesla to begin to roll out some more advanced ""FSD"" features?

post,6ob9we,,Autopiloting cross country: a 2015-2017 comparison,"TL/DR, autopiloting cross country was great in 2015 and is still great.

I first [traveled cross country in my Model S in 2015]( shortly after AP1 was introduced. Two years later, I just got back from my second supercharged cross country trip and thought that I’d share a comparison with last time. Both trips were made in the same late 2014 P85D (AP1).

1. **Autopilot Comparison**
    1. Wow, Autopilot nagging is a real thing! I don’t notice in my daily drives since I typically rest my hand on the steering wheel, which prevents the nag, and my daily drives are ~20 minutes. But in 2015, I used to be able to sit back for an hour’s stretch on long, flat areas in the midwest, plains, and southwestern deserts. Definitely not possible anymore now that it’s on a timer.
    2. The tendency to unintentionally take offramps seems to have actually gotten a little worse. 
    3. I finally experienced the phantom braking that people have been complaining about. It was never very aggressive and was never unsafe, but was an occasional annoyance. I’d say it happened 10-12 times over the 7,000 mile trip.
    4. Truck lust has been (mostly) fixed. Used to be a very dangerous bug, now just mildly dangerous :)
    5. Despite these minor complaints, AP definitely seems smoother and more reliable in general. I loved AP1 when it came out, and still think it’s the best thing. Sorry, AP2 guys, you don’t know what you’re missing :)
2. **Supercharging Comparison**
    1. So many new superchargers! Love being able to explore new states such as Iowa and Nebraska which were previously unavailable via supercharging.
    2. So many crowds! In 2015, I was usually the only one at any SC. Was surprised at how rare that was the case, especially in PA and the midwest. 
    3. In 2015, many SC visits came with owner chats or random strangers asking about the car. This happened far less frequently this time.
    4. Many SCs have expanded! For example, Barstow CA had maybe 8 in 2015? It now has 16!

post,69qomz,,2170 cells in S&X,"Anyone care to guess when this might happen? We know the 2170s have higher specific energy than the 18650s. The power pack/wall V2 with 2170s have DOUBLE the capacity compared to their 18650 predecessors. This is partly due to improvements in peripheral systems but largely due to cell level improvements.

If the S&X stay at 100kWh max with 2170 cells then their packs will get lighter, thereby increasing acceleration and range to some extent.

The other intriguing possibility is a significant bump in capacity. This would bring the S&X further away from the 3 and allow the 3 to reach its potential without cannibalising S&X sales. Elon has stated previously that Tesla would [probably stop at 100kWh]( but maybe this was before S/X cannibalisation was so much of a concern.

post,69761u,,Model 3 Range: Reading between the lines,"So, in the last few weeks, Elon has repeated a few lines concerning the Model S vs Model 3.

The 3 has “less range & power & fewer features.” than the Model S.  

Now, interesting enough, Tesla has eliminated the Model S 60 (210 Miles range) and offered a cheap upgrade to the 75 from the 60.  

Elon ALSO has hinted that they would beat the 239 Mile Range of the Chevy Bolt 



So, given the Model S has a base range of 249...the Bolt has a range 239 Miles. I think we'll see the Base Model 3 hit a range of 240-248 Miles.  I also think the top of the Model 3 range (the larger battery model) will be below the 100D model (335 Miles)",1493900584.0,2017-05-04 14:23:04,73,89,DrapedInVelvet,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/69761u/model_3_range_reading_between_the_lines/,True,0.9,2017,both,search,False,False,0,
post,689kry,,Musk: Level 5 Self-Driving in 2 Years,"From his TED talk:

On @Tesla autonomy, @TEDchris: ""How long until you can get in your car, fall asleep, and wake up at your destination?"" @elonmusk: ""2 years.""

— DAVE MORIN (@davemorin) April 28, 2017

I guess that ability would be required for the Tesla Network Car Service. Do you think at that point in 2019 AP2 HW will still be enough for the functionality? That would certainly influence my buying decision for an early Model 3.

Update: BMW also announced today that they will have an electric level 5 autonomous car on the road in the second half of 2021 in cooperation with Intel and Mobileye.

post,62gdjd,,It's no joke - there's no yoke.,"In the discussion around the 3's still-mysterious steering wheel/controls, I've seen a number of people suggest that the 3 might use a yoke-style steering system.  We even saw something similar in the design sketches used in the [Model 3 reservation thank-you cards](

However, with the release candidate video clip [posted last week]( I noticed that, as the vehicle drove away, there was enough overhead light to see the top of the steering, and though it's very brief, [one can clearly see that the design of the steering control itself sticks to the standard overall shape](  

Now, I'm well aware of Elon's tweet about the steering controls looking/feeling ""like a spaceship"", so there may very well still be more to the steering that would set it apart, but it doesn't look like it's shape will be part of that, if that clip is any indication.  Personally, I don't view that as a bad thing, since I think yoke-style steering looks cool but is simply not very practical for a car.  To be fair, there may very well be more at play, since we cannot see the main hub of the steering column at all.

Finally, I don't discount the possibility that they may have taken the steering out of the release candidate for this test, but if what we saw was truly the RC, it would presumably have had all the final hardware contained within.",1490903750.0,2017-03-30 21:55:50,11,21,Iambro,teslamotors,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/62gdjd/its_no_joke_theres_no_yoke/,True,0.8,2017,both,search,False,False,0,
post,62b7ov,,Every Model 3 Will Include Self-Driving Functionality as Standard (Educated Speculation),"To some extent, at the very least. If full self-driving functionality isn't included as standard, it will likely be in a very affordable capacity such as a subscription or bundled with an insurance/maintenance plan. The evidence is mounting:

Elon predominantly speaks of the Model 3 as self-driving. He makes it sound like the Model 3 will be rarely driven by a person, such as in his latest Tweet:

""The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?""

- @elonmusk

It sounds like Elon has been letting the cat out of the bag since the unveiling, and we have been oblivious to it. If the majority of people are only spending $35-$42k, does a Tweet like that make sense when full autonomy costs $10k on the Model S/X? No, unless every Model 3 will ship with self-driving functionality, or at least some of the features such as speed/distance control. That is becoming more likely: if every Model 3 doesn't ship with full autonomy, it is sounding very likely it will ship with Autopilot-type features as standard that mainly require the driver to steer. Elon wants every Model 3 to be self-driving, and that won't happen if it's a $10k option. 

There are also past Tweets that make it sound like the Model 3's final ""spaceship"" interior will be made for self-driving. 

Of course, very critically to this theory, every Model 3 will already ship with full Autopilot hardware. It's just a flip of the switch to enable autonomy, rather than making it an option. 

There is immense value to Tesla in having every Model 3 be self-driving: owners can use Model 3's as taxis that will likely generate more revenue than charging for the feature would. With the scale, it's likely full autonomy would've only been a few thousand. *Including autonomy in insurance/maintenance packages to make it more affordable is also a possibility. Tesla Motors is just the beginning of Tesla's profitability.

post,5qyjib,,I'm getting really excited about Model 3!,"I haven't been this excited about Model 3 in a while. I was realizing that January is already over on Tuesday. We're already stepping into February and any day now we should have an earnings report from Tesla. With Elon on the call, hopefully he'll spill something about the Model 3 event.

Sometime after the earnings call, we'll get a Tweet from Elon naming the Model 3 event details. it'll have to be within the first week or two of March at the latest. Before we know it, ""Part 3"" (Previously known as Part 2) will be here! All of this, is just weeks away.

I was digging through his old tweets/replies out of excitement and I hadn't realized how much Elon has been hyping up ""Part 3"" in the past. I knew he had talked about it, but not to this extent. Here's a handful of them!

I also can't wait for the tinier changes. Though the first tweet I'm linking has me hoping he does _not_ change the front end! Also, found it interesting that he plans for the AWD production version to be ""much faster"" than what they had out for test drives at Part 1. Those were already very quick according to people at the event.
